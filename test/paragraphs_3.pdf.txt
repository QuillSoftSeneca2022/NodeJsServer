<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>

<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>ABSTRACT </header>
<header>The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic </header>
<header>caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in </header>
<header>nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand </header>
<header>derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected </header>
<header>person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two </header>
<header>antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO </header>
<header>recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs </header>
<header>effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular </header>
<header>testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory. </header>

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40).

<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>ABSTRACT </header>
<header>The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic </header>
<header>caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in </header>
<header>nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand </header>
<header>derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected </header>
<header>person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two </header>
<header>antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO </header>
<header>recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs </header>
<header>effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular </header>

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40).

Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has

Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>ABSTRACT </header>
<header>The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic </header>
<header>caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in </header>
<header>nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand </header>
<header>derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected </header>
<header>person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two </header>
<header>antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO </header>
<header>recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs </header>
<header>effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular </header>
<header>testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory. </header>

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>ABSTRACT </header>
<header>The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic </header>
<header>caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in </header>
<header>nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand </header>
<header>derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected </header>
<header>person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two </header>
<header>antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO </header>
<header>recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs </header>
<header>effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular </header>

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40).

<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>ABSTRACT </header>
<header>The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic </header>
<header>caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in </header>
<header>nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand </header>
<header>derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected </header>
<header>person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two </header>
<header>antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO </header>
<header>recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs </header>
<header>effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular </header>
<header>testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory. </header>

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40).

Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>ABSTRACT </header>
<header>The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic </header>
<header>caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in </header>
<header>nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand </header>
<header>derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected </header>
<header>person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two </header>
<header>antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO </header>
<header>recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs </header>
<header>effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular </header>
<header>testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory. </header>

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>

Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of

Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>ABSTRACT </header>
<header>The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic </header>
<header>caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in </header>
<header>nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand </header>
<header>derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected </header>
<header>person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two </header>
<header>antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO </header>
<header>recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs </header>
<header>effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular </header>
<header>testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory. </header>

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<header>ABSTRACT </header>
<header>The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic </header>
<header>caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in </header>
<header>nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand </header>
<header>derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected </header>
<header>person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two </header>

<header>1. INTRODUCTION </header>
<header>This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was </header>
<header>first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed </header>
<header>that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. </header>
<header>farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, </header>
<header>thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species </header>
<header>infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian </header>
<header>virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine </header>
<header>flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico </header>
<header>USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it </header>
<header>is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main </header>
<header>surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 </header>
<header>(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been </header>
<header>reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the </header>
<header>mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that </header>
<header>of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of </header>
<header>"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, </header>
<header>whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 </header>
<header>%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated </header>
<header>to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of </header>
<header>influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly </header>
<header>identified by its surface antigens by immunological </header>
<header>techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person </header>
<header>either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the </header>
<header>infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to </header>
<header>note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. </header>
<header>Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease </header>
<header>was not observed much until it came into lime light after the </header>
<header>pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the </header>
<header>world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the </header>
<header>virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- </header>
<header>vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus </header>
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<header>and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. </header>
<header>Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of </header>
<header>SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). </header>
<header>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </header>
<header>Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a </header>
<header>segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types </header>
<header>(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human </header>
<header>populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would </header>
<header>fall into this category of human to human transferable </header>
<header>viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a </header>
<header>respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that </header>
<header>infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight </header>
<header>RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 </header>
<header>(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that </header>
<header>can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of </header>
<header>surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When </header>
<header>humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis </header>
<header>or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of </header>
<header>being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as </header>
<header>a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research </header>
<header>shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu </header>
<header>have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from </header>
<header>avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). </header>
<header>There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 </header>
<header>Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations </header>
<header>and causing different types of flus shown as follows: </header>
<header>H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus </header>
<header>H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 </header>
<header>H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens </header>

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<header>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </header>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus

and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header><header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>2 
H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header><header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets.

The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header><header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion

glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header><header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. 
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header><header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<heading>ABSTRACT </heading>
The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus

and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents.

Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets.

The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>

Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<heading>ABSTRACT </heading>
The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus

and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
2 
H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets.

The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>

Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<heading>ABSTRACT </heading>
The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
2 
H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<heading>ABSTRACT </heading>
The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus

and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40).

<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<heading>ABSTRACT </heading>
The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface.

Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets.

The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>

Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<heading>ABSTRACT </heading>
The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
2 
H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40).

Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while

Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines.

and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by

(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<heading>ABSTRACT </heading>
The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
2 
H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>

Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

<heading>ABSTRACT </heading>
The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in USA. Pandemic 
caused by H1N1 in 2009 brought it in limelight. It's a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in 
nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand 
derived from human flu strains, two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected 
person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two 
antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO 
recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs 
effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular 
testing (RT-PCR) are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.

<heading>1. INTRODUCTION </heading>
This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was 
first isolated from pigs in 1930 in U.S.A., It has been noticed 
that people who are in close proximity to pigs (for e.g. 
farmers, pork processors etc.) usually get the infection, 
thereby causing similar symptoms. The cross-species 
infections (swine virus to human; human virus to pigs, avian 
virus to human and pigs) have been found globally. Swine 
flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico 
USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it 
is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main 
surface antigens,H1 (Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 
(Neuraminidase type 1). By June 2009, the virus had been 
reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the 
mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that 
of the conventional flu. In 1918 there was an epidemic of 
"Spanish flu" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, 
whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 
%.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated 
to be less than 0.2 %. Swine flu is caused by a type of 
influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly 
identified by its surface antigens by immunological 
techniques. This virus is transmitted from person to person 
either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the 
infected person sneezes and coughs. It is important here to 
note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork. 
Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease 
was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
2 
H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death. 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets. 
<footer>Copyright © 2012 SciResPub. </footer>
The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.

was not observed much until it came into lime light after the 
pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the 
world. Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the 
virus and have come up with several vaccine and non- 
vaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus

and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future. 
Complication of H1N1 though rare could in the form of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 
<heading>I. MORPHOLOGY, TYPES & LIFE CYCLE </heading>
Human Influenza (flu) are enveloped RNA viruses with a 
segmented eight different RNA and are of three major types 
(Influenza Type A, B, or C) that are common to the human 
populace (Orthomyxoviridae). Maximum seasonal flu would 
fall into this category of human to human transferable 
viruses. Swine flu (swine influenza, H1N1 flu) is a 
respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that 
infect the respiratory tract of pigs. The virus consists of eight 
RNA strands and has two main surface antigens, H1 
(Hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1) , that 
can mutate over time causing changes to the structure of 
surface proteins called antigens and infects humans. When 
humans get infections from animals it is termed as Zoonosis 
or a zoonotic disease. Pig's respiratory cells are capable of 
being infested with many types of flu viruses and can act as 
a "mingling vessel" for flu RNA segments. Topical research 
shows that the eight RNA strands from unique H1N1 flu 
have one strand derived from human flu strains, two from 
avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains (figure 2.1). 
There are 16 different Hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 
Neuraminidase subtypes showing different combinations 
and causing different types of flus shown as follows: 
H5N1 Subtype - bird flu virus 
H3N2 Subtype - Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 
H5N2 Subtype - highly pathogenic in chickens

H3N8 Subtype - frequently found in horses 
H2N2 Subtype - Asian flu pandemic of 1957 
H7N7 Subtype - 2003 poultry epidemic 
H1N1 Subtype - Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and swine flu 
Anatomically Swine flu virus consists of eight RNA strands 
(joined with numerous proteins B1, PB2, PA, NP) and has 
two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and 
N1 (neuraminidase type1). The interior of the virion 
comprises of additional protein called NEP. M1 protein 
(matrix protein) gives strength and rigidity to the lipid 
envelope, M2 protein targets antiviral drugs (figure 2.1). 
Neuraminidase is an enzyme that supports the virus to 
breach cell walls and it is also called as sialidase because it 
breaks the linkages between sialic acid and cellular 
glycoproteins as well as glycolipids found in cell walls. 
Neuraminidase is a mushroom-like projection on the surface 
of the influenza viruses. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein 
that fixes the virus to the cell being infested. The 
hemagglutinin molecule is actually a combination of three 
identical proteins which are bound together to form an 
elongated cylindrical shape. 
Swine influenza virus or swine-origin influenza virus 
belongs to influenza family which is common in pigs and 
their subtypes are H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, and 
H2N3. 
Lifecycle of swine flu virus, H1N1 can be initiated very 
effortlessly because it is predictable to live outside of 
humans for 2 to 48 hours and it can attach itself to any 
surface like towel, clothes, table, doorknob or anything 
touched by an infected person. The Swine Flu life cycle 
mainly has seven phases: 
The swine flu virus antigens attached to the surface of 
cells in the nose, throat and lungs. 
The cell engulfs the virus. 
The virus is able to penetrate the bubble of cell 
membrane that encloses it and release its RNA into it. 
In the nucleus, replicas of the viral RNA are made. 
Viral mRNA causes the cell to prepare viral proteins. 
These proteins and RNA migrate to the cell's surface 
where they are amassed into novel virus particles. 
Novel virus start budding off from the cell surface. 
<heading>2. SYMPTOMS </heading>
Swine flu virus causes clinical symptoms (figure 3.1) in 
human beings which are analogous to other influenza 
viruses and are further categorized into following: 
Common symptoms are fever (100 F or greater), cough, 
nasal secretion, fatigue, and headache with fatigue. 
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and 
sometimes collateral tissue damage. 
In severe cases patients can have severe respiratory 
symptoms there by needing respiratory support. 
Complications: pneumonia due to secondary bacterial 
infection, seizures, and rarely death.

<heading>3. DIAGNOSIS </heading>
It is recommended that only hospitalized patients undergo 
the tests from reference labs. Swine flu can be diagnosed by 
two approaches: 
Presumptive diagnosis: it can be made through patient's 
history along with clinical symptoms 
Definitive diagnosis: it is made through laboratory 
investigations which are as follows 
Quick tests (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) 
are done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A 
or B virus. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or 
positive for type A and B. If the test is positive for type 
B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu (H1N1) and if it is 
positive for type A, then the person could have a 
predictable flu strain or swine flu (H1N1).Though these 
tests are quick but are less precise and non-specific for 
H1N1. 
Swine flu (H1N1) is definitively diagnosed by detecting 
the particular antigens associated with the virus type. 
These tests are done in a specialized laboratory. Because 
of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that 
occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of 
flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu 
viruses), it was recommended that only hospitalized 
patients' flu virus strains should be sent to reference labs 
for identification. Rapid antigen testing (RIDT), DFA 
testing, viral culture, and molecular testing (RT-PCR) 
are used for its diagnosis. 
<heading>4. RISK FACTORS </heading>
Certain strata of population are at a higher risk for getting 
H1N1 infection or developing severe complications from it. 
These people should be vaccinated to prevent swine flu. 
People at higher risk for H1N1 are: 
Children between 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of 
age. 
People at and above 50 years of age. 
Children and Adults with chronic respiratory (including 
asthma) or cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, 
hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes 
mellitus). 
Immuno-compromised people (HIV or AIDS infected). 
Pregnant women or those who will be pregnant during 
the influenza season. 
Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) 
on long-term aspirin therapy and those at a risk of 
suffering Reye's syndrome after influenza virus 
infection. 
Nursing homes residents. 
Grossly overweight people (BMI �40). 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
3 
Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, other 
personnel likely to come in close contact of patient while 
treating them). 
Caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 
50 years of age and older, particularly vaccinating 
contacts of children less than 6 month's age. 
Caregivers of people with medical conditions who are at 
higher risk for severe complications from influenza. 
<heading>5. PREVENTION </heading>
Novel Swine flu can be prevented with or without vaccines. 
Prevention without vaccines is principally to avoid exposure 
and /or contact to the virus. This could be achieved by 
frequent hand washing, good hygiene, and use of face 
masks. Practice of drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza can avert 
the disease, or if taken within 48 hours of rising symptoms 
can diminish the severity. Preventive measures should also 
be taken by people having symptoms of flu. They should 
stay at home and evade crowded places. For sneezing, 
coughing, and nasal secretions tissue should be used and 
appropriately disposed off later. 
Prevention with vaccines is the greatest way for humans to 
avert swine flu virus infection, A blend of methods that are 
aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle, if the virus 
doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, 
infection will not take place. 
The approaches are as follows: 
Kill or attenuate the virus before it spreads a human cell, 
by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing 
clothing and taking a shower etc. 
Practice an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and 
water are not readily accessible, and use disinfectants on 
objects that many people may touch (for example, 
doorknobs, keyboards, handrails, mobiles). 
Disinfect hands before touching mouth, eyes and nose. 
Avoid congested places, parties, and also people who 
are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing 
droplets can travel only about 3 to 4 feet, so it is advised 
that one should maintain a safe distance of 6 feet ). If it is 
not possible to avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain 
aware of people around and use the 6-foot rule with 
anyone who is found coughing or sneezing. 
Avoid touching anything within approximately 6 feet 
distance of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the 
droplets containing virus usually fall and land on 
anything within that range. 
Studies conducted recently have shown that wearing 
surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation 
of H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 
50% of aerosols exposures and offer no protection 
against surface droplets which may be carrying virus. 
However, masks if used by H1N1 infected people can 
noticeably reduce the spread of infected droplets.

The above steps can help prevent individuals from 
getting H1N1 and other types of infection. 
Vaccination is particularly significant for individuals at 
a higher risk for developing influenza or other 
analogous viral infections. The first vaccine was released 
in early October 2009. It was a nasal spray vaccine and 
was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2 
through 49. The injectable vaccine, made from killed 
H1N1, could be used in ages 06 months to the elderly 
and was safe even for pregnant women. Both these 
vaccines were accepted only after conducting clinical 
trials which proved that the vaccines were harmless and 
effective. As flu shot is made from killed virus particles 
so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot, whereas, 
the nasal spray vaccine comprises of live viruses that 
have been changed to hamper its ability to replicate in 
human tissue; therefore people with suppressed 
immunity should not get vaccinated with the nasal 
spray. Most vaccines comprising flu viral particles are 
cultivated in eggs, and hence are unsafe for use in 
individuals with an allergy to eggs unless tested and 
instructed by their clinician. As with all vaccines, 
infrequent adverse reactions may occur in some rare 
cases such as swelling, weakness, or shortness of breath. 
If any such symptoms progress, the person should visit 
a physician immediately. The vaccines which are 
available for swine flu till date have some side effects 
and common side effects are: 
Flu shot: tenderness, reddishness, slight swelling at the 
shot site, myalgia, low grade fever, and nausea. These 
symptoms usually last not more than 24 hours. 
Nasal spray: running nose, low-grade fever, headache, 
wheezing, cough, and sore throat. 
<heading>6. TREATMENT </heading>
Swine flu can be treated with antiviral drugs and vaccines. 
People who fall in "at-risk" group should be treated 
with antiviral drugs (oseltamivir or zanamivir) as rapidly as 
possible when they first experience flu. Acetaminophen and 
ibuprofen may be a drug of choice to reduce symptoms. Two 
types of vaccines are used for the treatment of flu, live 
vaccine and inactivated vaccine. Novel H1N1 influenza 
vaccines available in India are: 
A live monovalent novel H1N1 vaccine (Serum Institute 
of India). Immunogenicity, and safety of the vaccine has 
been established in pre-licensure animal and human 
studies 
The inactivated novel H1N1 monovalent vaccine by 
Zydus is licensed for use only in adults above the age of 
18 years. 
Trivalent inactivated vaccine containing the novel H1N1 
strain is available now (Chiron, Solvay, Lupin, GSK and 
<header>International Journal of Advancements in Research & Technology, Volume 1, Issue2, July-2012 </header>
<header>ISSN 2278-7763 </header>
4 
Sanofi Pasteur). The 2010--11 trivalent vaccines contain 
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009 
(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens. The 
influenza A (H1N1) vaccine virus is derived from a 2009 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. 
Both medications have known side effects, including 
lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite 
and trouble breathing. 
Dose and route of admiration: live vaccine 0.25 ml of the 
reconstituted vaccine in each nostril. Inactivated vaccine 0.5 
ml intramuscular (for children between 6 month and 3 years 
half the dose should be given). Number of doses for children 
less than 9 years should be two doses 28 days apart. For 
children above 9 years one dose is sufficient. 
<heading>7. PROGNOSIS </heading>
About 90% of patients who get the disease have severe 
symptoms but recuperate without many problems. Only 
people who have suppressed immune system have a bad out 
come with increased mortality. Pregnant women, children 
less than two years of age have bad prognosis. Complication 
of H1N1 could in the form of SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome). It has been found that most of the people 
worldwide who get H1N1 flu recover without medical 
treatment and have very good prognosis.
