 style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:9; color:#221F1F; bold;Case  style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:9; color:#221F1F; bold;Presentation: We present the case of a 38-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital primarily with respiratory 
manifestations and developed acute cerebellar ataxia during hospital stay, causing a diagnostic dilemma, as his cerebrospinal fluid 
analysis and magnetic resonance imaging brain were unremarkable. Throat swab real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction {rRT-PCR) turned out positive for influenza A {H1N1) pdm09 virus strain and a nontypeable influenza A strain. He showed 
the resolution of cerebellar signs and a remarkable recovery on oseltamivir therapy. Based on the acute onset, positive RT-PCR 
and recovery on antiviral, a diagnosis of H1N1-associated cerebellitis was made. 
 style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:9; color:#221F1F; bold;Conclusion: This report highlights an extremely rare complication of influenza infection with only five reported cases in adults and 
case series in children. Vigilance and a high index of suspicion for patients presenting with rapid onset neurological deterioration 
during pandemics and seasonal epidemics can prevent devastating sequelae.

<heading>Background </heading>
H1N1 influenza continues in the post-pandemic phase as 
seasonal influenza, after its initial outbreak in Mexico in 
the year 2009. Annual influenza epidemics result in 3–5 
million cases of severe illness and an estimated 250,000– 
500,000 deaths each year [1]. Neurological manifesta- 
tions in influenza infections are diverse and rarely seen. 
The estimated incidence of influenza-related neurological 
complications (INCs) was 1.2 per 100,000 symptomatic 
pdm09 H1N1 illnesses, as they were observed in 4% of 
patients with fatal or severe H1N1 infections in one study; 
however, more than three-fourth of these cases were in the 
paediatric age group [2]. 
There is a considerable overlap between acute cerebel- 
<heading>J </heading>
lar ataxia and acute cerebellitis as both are characterised 
by parainfectious, postinfectious, or postvaccination cere- 
bellar inflammation [3]. Cerebellitis cases in H1N1 infec- 
tion in children have been reported in the form of case 
series; however, there are few case reports in adults. In the 
PubMed-based literature review, there were five reported 
cases of influenza-associated cerebellitis [4–8] in adults 
and only two in association with H1N1 pdm09 strain in 
adults [6,8]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
reported case in Pakistan with this presentation in an adult.

to the Emergency Department of Military Hospital 
Rawalpindi on 3/1/18 with a 3-day history of fever, cough, 
sore throat and vomiting. The cough was productive, 
containing scanty mucoid sputum; fever was high grade 
associated with rigors and chills. The patient had taken 
co-amoxiclav but had found no relief. The past medical 
history was unremarkable. He was a non-smoker, with no 
recent contact with sick persons and no recent history of 
immunisation against influenza vaccination. 
Physical examination revealed that he had a fever of 
102°F, blood pressure of 100/70 mm Hg, pulse rate of 104 
beats/minute and respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute; he 
was maintaining saturation on room air (97%). The throat 
was erythematous and congested. Chest auscultation 
revealed bilateral crepitation. The cardiovascular exami- 
nation was unremarkable. The neck was supple, there was 
no rash noted and no lymph nodes were palpable. 
Baseline blood count revealed a total leucocyte count 
of 10,900/mm3 with neutrophilia (90%), and his renal 
function tests, electrolytes and liver enzymes were within 
normal limits. High-resolution computed tomography 
(HRCT) scan chest showed bilateral patchy consolida- 
tions, ground-glass opacities and airspace nodules. He was 
hospitalised, and the treatment was started on lines of atyp- 
ical pneumonia with antibiotics and supportive therapy. 
On day 2 of admission, the patient developed slow 
intentional tremors and complained of headache and

sudden onset difficulty in balance and walking. There was 
no associated history of fits or previous history of neuro- 
logical disease. He had no cognitive or behavioural defi- 
cits. Neurological examination revealed GCS 15/15, no 
neck stiffness, intact deep tendon reflexes and bilaterally 
down going planters. Gait was broad based and ataxic, 
and he had impaired coordination manifesting as bilateral 
past pointing, nystagmus, dysdiadochokinesia and dysme- 
tria. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. 
His cerebrospinal fluid analysis opening pressure was 
normal, cell count was 1 cell/mm3, with occasional lym- 
phocytes, glucose was 63 mg/dl (serum, 139 mg/dl) and 
total protein was 26 mg/dl. Gram stain and AFB stain were 
negative. Urine, sputum and blood cultures were nega- 
tive for any pathogens. Urine antigen tests for  style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:9.96; color:#221F1F;Legionella 
 style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:9.96; color:#221F1F;pneumophila and Mycoplasma serology were also neg- 
ative. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and 
anti-neuronal profile were negative. Extractable nuclear 
antigens were also negative. Serum CK levels were 1479 
U/l. A thorough review of drug intake was made, and 
drug-induced ataxia was excluded. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with contrast 
showed no abnormality to guide the diagnosis other than 
a persistent cavum septum pellucidum and cavum verge 
which are considered as normal variants. 
A throat swab had been collected and sent to the 
National Influenza Center, National Institute of Health, 
Islamabad, for real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase 
chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The sample was tested based 
on Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
rRT-PCR protocol for the detection and characterisa- 
tion of swine influenza. It was positive for influenza A 
(H1N1) pdm09 virus strain and a nontypeable influenza 
A strain. The patient was given a course of oseltamivir 75 
mg twice daily for 5 days, Intravenous immunoglobulin, 
plasmapheresis and admission to intensive care unit were 
kept under consideration due to patient’s rapid  style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:9.96; color:#221F1F;onset  style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:9.96; color:#221F1F;of 
symptoms and sudden deterioration. However, his tremors 
improved over the next 3 days and ataxia resolved over 
the next 1 week. Based on positive H1N1 RT-PCR and 
onset of acute cerebellar syndrome, a diagnosis of H1N1- 
associated cerebellitis was made. 
He had no permanent or residual neurological seque- 
lae and was discharged after a hospital stay of 22 days. 
Follow-up neurological examination after 3 months 
revealed no residual neurological deficit. 
<heading>Discussion </heading>
Acute cerebellitis in adults is a rare entity with a wide 
range of aetiology, clinical presentation and outcomes. 
The patient developed neurological symptoms 4 days 
after disease onset. The median time from the onset of 
influenza symptoms to the onset of neurologic symptoms 
ranges from day 1 to 5, and almost all cases had onset 
of neurologic symptoms within 5 days of illness onset in 
<pagenumber>53 </pagenumber>one study [9]. Direct invasion and cytokines have been 
proposed as the likely mechanisms behind acute onset 
neurological complications, whereas adaptive immune 
responses in subacute onset [9]. 
A diagnosis of H1N1 infection requires confirmation 
by RT-PCR of throat/nasopharyngeal swabs, viral culture, 
or four-fold rise in new influenza A (H1N1) virus-spe- 
cific neutralising antibodies [10]. The cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) was abnormal in only 4 (22%) patients in another 
study on INC [9]. In this case, CSF was not tested for viral 
influenza RT-PCR, whereas it was positive in CSF for one 
of the H1N1-associated cerebellitis cases [8]. Although 
testing CSF for influenza virus RNA may help to establish 
influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE), a negative 
PCR does not rule out the diagnosis. In a study by Meijer 
et al., the influenza virus was detected in CSF of minority 
(16%) of patients [11]. 
MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality and is used 
to either confirm a diagnosis or rule out other likely dif- 
ferentials; however, in this case and in other various cases 
in literature, it was unremarkable [3,4]. Only 43% (10/23) 
had imaging abnormalities in one study [9], and 55% of 
patients had normal imaging studies in a literature review 
on INC [12]. Regardless of pathogenesis, the most char- 
acteristic finding by MRI in cerebellitis is diffuse cortical 
swelling of the cerebellum which can be complicated in 
the form of hydrocephalus/tonsillar herniation. Imaging 
and CSF findings are summarised in Table 1. 
The treatment of acute cerebellitis depends on the aeti- 
ology and complications. Antimicrobials and antivirals are 
the mainstay in infectious aetiologies. When brain MRI 
shows diffuse cerebellar swelling, patients should also 
be treated with corticosteroids to prevent further swelling 
and brain herniation [13]. Surgical interventions such as 
external ventricular drain might also be required in hydro- 
cephalus. In H1N1-related neurological complications, 
antivirals should be ideally started within 48 hours of the 
onset of clinical symptoms [10]. The patient’s  style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:9.96; color:#221F1F;condition 
also improved after initiation of antiviral. Almost 25 (86%) 
patients had received antiviral within 48 hours of hospital- 
isation in the United States study, but all had received such 
treatment after neurologic symptoms had begun [2]. 
Almost half of the patients ended up with neurological 
sequelae in a review on adult cases of cerebellitis, with 
cerebellar atrophy given as a plausible explanation for 
the cause [13]. CSF analysis and MRI appear to have a 
prognostic value in patients with acute onset neurological 
complications of influenza virus infection [11]. In a study 
by Meijer et al. [11], all the patients with normal CSF 
analysis (chemistry and/or PCR) and 7/9 (78 %) patients 
with normal MRI made a full recovery. This is consistent 
with the normal CSF and MRI imaging in this case and 
the patient’s remarkable recovery without any permanent 
neurological sequelae.

<heading>Conclusion </heading>
This case highlights a rare and potentially devastating mani- 
festation of influenza infection. Clinicians should maintain a 
high index of suspicion particularly in peak seasons and high- 
risk populations. A national surveillance study, such as those 
done in the UK and US regarding neurological manifestations 
and their outcomes in the population, can further guide clini- 
cians in diagnosis and management of these complications. 
<heading>What is new? </heading>
This case report is based on a rare manifestation of H1N1 
2009 pandemic strain or swine flu. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first such reported case in an adult 
in Pakistan; the case highlights the importance of early rec- 
ognition and treatment of influenza-associated cerebellitis/ 
acute cerebellar syndrome and gives a brief review of other 
reported cases in literature.
