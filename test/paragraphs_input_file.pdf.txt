<ln>22</ln><heading>Abstract </heading>
<ln>23</ln><heading>Background </heading>
<ln>24</ln><p>A swine flu pandemic hit the world and India was no </p>
<ln>25</ln><p>exception. Many deaths were reported in metropolitan </p>
<ln>26</ln><p>cities. Knowledge about the infection is an important </p>
<ln>27</ln><p>element of control of the infection. </p>
<ln>28</ln><heading>Method </heading>
<ln>29</ln><p>This cross sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary care </p>
<ln>30</ln><p>centre hospital where the patients are referred from </p>
<ln>31</ln><p>different parts of Haryana accompanied by relatives </p>
<ln>32</ln><p>therefore it was regarded as a potentially high-risk area for </p>
<ln>33</ln><p>the spread of Influenza A (H1N1) and chosen to assess the </p>
<ln>34</ln><p>knowledge, attitude and practice in relation to swine flu. A </p>
<ln>35</ln><p>self administered questionnaire involved 42 hospital staff </p>
<ln>36</ln><p>members (HS) and 358 general public (GP) accompanying </p>
<ln>37</ln><p>the patients from 1st September 2009 to 15th October 2009. </p>
<ln>38</ln><heading>Results </heading>
<ln>39</ln><p>Out of all respondents only 25% had heard of swine flu </p>
<ln>40</ln><p>before and out of which 65% HS & 37% GP knew more than </p>
<ln>41</ln><p>three correct symptoms. There were 86% respondents </p>
<ln>42</ln><p>(HS=95% & GP=80%) who thought that touching the eyes, </p>
<ln>43</ln><p>nose or mouth without washing hands can spread the </p>
<ln>44</ln><p>disease. Altogether 80% respondents thought that the </p>
<ln>45</ln><p>disease was controllable while, nearly 92% of respondents </p>
<ln>46</ln><p>knew about the nearest swine flu control or testing centre. </p>
<ln>47</ln><p>Among all hardly 10% had attended some type of </p>
<ln>48</ln><p>awareness program for swine flu control and 62% were </p>
<ln>49</ln><p>taking precautions against the spread of swine flu. Nearly </p>
<ln>50</ln><p>70% of respondents thought that masks prevent the disease </p>
<ln>51</ln><p>while about 98% washed their hands before having meal. </p>
<ln>52</ln><p>Nearly 72% of this knowledge was from television and 20% </p>
<ln>53</ln><p>from newspapers. </p>
<ln>54</ln><heading>Conclusion </heading>
<ln>55</ln><p>In the present study group many of the respondents didn’t </p>
<ln>56</ln><p>know about swine flu. Most were from the general </p>
<ln>57</ln><p>population. We recommend a public health campaign in </p>
<ln>58</ln><p>Haryana. </p>

<ln>61</ln><heading>Background </heading>
<ln>62</ln><p>Swine Flu pandemic detected in April 2009 contained </p>
<ln>63</ln><p>a combination of genes from swine, avian (bird), and human </p>
<ln>64</ln><p>influenza viruses.1,2 </p>
<ln>65</ln><p>The outbreak began in Mexico, with </p>
<ln>66</ln><p>evidence that there had been an ongoing epidemic for </p>
<ln>67</ln><p>months before it was officially recognized as such.3 The </p>
<ln>68</ln><p>virus continued to spread globally, and the World Health </p>
<ln>69</ln><p>Organization (WHO) in June declared the outbreak to be a </p>
<ln>70</ln><p>pandemic4 and raised a strong signal that a pandemic is </p>
<ln>71</ln><p>imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, </p>
<ln>72</ln><p>communication and implementation of the planned </p>
<ln>73</ln><p>mitigation measures is short. As of 6 August 2009, the </p>
<ln>74</ln><p>World Health Organization reported 1,77,457 laboratory </p>
<ln>75</ln><p>confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1 and 1,462 deaths.5 </p>
<ln>76</ln><p>India was no exception and many deaths (138 as of 9 </p>
<ln>77</ln><p>September 2009) were reported in metropolitan cities such </p>
<ln>78</ln><p>as Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore.6 Given the seriousness of </p>
<ln>79</ln><p>the situation and lack of any specific vaccine against </p>
<ln>80</ln><p>Influenza A (H1N1), mitigation measures in the India have so </p>

<ln>82</ln><header>Australasian Medical Journal AMJ 2010, 3, 9, 614-617 </header>
<ln>83</ln><p>far focused on identifying, treating, and isolating people </p>
<ln>84</ln><p>who have the disease and educating the public about the </p>
<ln>85</ln><p>steps that individuals can take to reduce the risk of </p>
<ln>86</ln><p>transmission. These recommendations include using tissues </p>
<ln>87</ln><p>when sneezing, washing hands regularly with soap and </p>
<ln>88</ln><p>water.7 The media, including both televised and written </p>
<ln>89</ln><p>media, and to a lesser extent the radio and the internet, </p>
<ln>90</ln><p>where free uncensored writing and U-tube postings take </p>
<ln>91</ln><p>place had led to inappropriate behaviour by the public such </p>
<ln>92</ln><p>as; refusal to comply with precautionary measures, </p>
<ln>93</ln><p>including wearing a mask or accepting a vaccination; </p>
<ln>94</ln><p>avoidance of certain activities including visiting the hospital </p>
<ln>95</ln><p>due to fear of healthcare facilities as a venue for acquiring </p>
<ln>96</ln><p>the infection.8-10 </p>
<ln>97</ln><p>There was a large need for the </p>
<ln>98</ln><p>dissemination of accurate information to overcome the </p>
<ln>99</ln><p>misinformed dialogue taking place on TV, newspapers and </p>
<ln>100</ln><p>internet. </p>
<ln>101</ln><p>11 During a pandemic, public health agencies can </p>
<ln>102</ln><p>play critical roles in controlling the spread of disease.12 </p>
<ln>103</ln><p>Therefore the present study was designed to assess the </p>
<ln>104</ln><p>knowledge, attitude and practice during swine flu epidemic </p>
<ln>105</ln><p>among the medical staff and the general population. </p>
<ln>106</ln><heading>Method </heading>
<ln>107</ln><p>This cross sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary care </p>
<ln>108</ln><p>centre hospital where the patients are referred from </p>
<ln>109</ln><p>different parts of Haryana accompanied by relatives </p>

<ln>116</ln><heading>Results </heading>
<ln>117</ln><p>A total of 400 subjects (Hospital staff= 42 & general </p>
<ln>118</ln><p>population= 358) with mean ± SD age group of 31.42 ± </p>
<ln>119</ln><p>10.65 years (Range= 12 – 62 years) participated in the study. </p>
<ln>120</ln><p>There were 214 males and 186 females. </p>
<ln>121</ln><heading>Knowledge response </heading>
<ln>122</ln><p>Out of all respondents only 25% (100) had heard of swine </p>
<ln>123</ln><p>flu before. Out of these 25% (100) respondents, 95% (38) </p>
<ln>124</ln><p>hospital staff (HS) and 100% (60) of general population (GP) </p>
<ln>125</ln><p>knew about symptoms of swine flu. Sixty five percent of HS </p>
<ln>126</ln><p>and thirty seven percent of GP knew more than three </p>
<ln>127</ln><p>correct symptoms. 65% of HS and 74% of GP thought that </p>
<ln>128</ln><p>this was a disease of children and elderly patients, while </p>
<ln>129</ln><p>35% of HS and 22% of GP thought that adults with co </p>
<ln>130</ln><p>morbidities like asthma and diabetes were at a greater risk </p>
<ln>131</ln><p>and only 2% of GP didn’t know about it. There were 95% HS </p>
<ln>132</ln><p>and 86% general people who thought that touching of eyes, </p>
<ln>133</ln><p>nose or mouth without washing hands can spread the </p>
<ln>134</ln><p>disease while only 5% HS and 10% GP thought that it was </p>
<ln>135</ln><p>partially true and 6.66 % of GP didn’t know the answer. </p>
<ln>136</ln><p>Altogether, 80% of HS and GP thought that the disease was </p>
<ln>137</ln><p>controllable while, 15% of HS and 10% of GP thought that it </p>
<ln>138</ln><p>was not and 10% of GP didn’t know the answer. Nearly 95% </p>
<ln>139</ln><p>of HS and 92% of GP knew about the nearest swine flu </p>
<ln>140</ln><p>control or testing centre and half of HS were aware of the </p>
<ln>141</ln><heading>Practice response </heading>
<ln>142</ln><p>About 98% respondents (HS=100% & GP=96.67%) wash </p>
<ln>143</ln><p>their hands before having meals. 62% (HS=55% & </p>
<ln>144</ln><p>GP=66.67%) were definitely taking precautions against the </p>
<ln>145</ln><p>spread of swine flu while 14% (HS=20% & GP=10%) were </p>
<ln>146</ln><p>taking partial precautions, while 24% (HS=25% & </p>
<ln>147</ln><p>GP=23.33%) were not taking any precautions. Disposal of </p>
<ln>148</ln><p>mask was done by throwing them into the dustbin by 34% </p>
<ln>149</ln><p>(HS=60% & GP=16.67%) while, disposal by burning was </p>
<ln>150</ln><p>done by 20% (HS=30% & GP=13.33%). However, 46% </p>
<ln>151</ln><p>(HS=10% & GP=70%) did not know how to dispose masks. Of </p>
<ln>152</ln><p>the respondents 46% (HS=80% & GP=23.33%) thought that </p>
<ln>153</ln><p>it was not safe to reuse the mask more than once and 3.33% </p>
<ln>154</ln><p>general population thought that this was partially true while </p>
<ln>155</ln><p>40% respondents (HS=10% & P=60%) did not knew the </p>
<ln>156</ln><p>answer and 12% (HS= 10% & GP=13.33%) answered that </p>
<ln>157</ln><p>mask can be reused. There were 94% (HS=85% & GP=100%) </p>
<ln>158</ln><p>of respondents who thought that if they had developed the </p>
<ln>159</ln><p>symptoms of swine flu then they would have contacted the </p>
<ln>160</ln><p>swine flu centre immediately for diagnosis while only 10% </p>
<ln>161</ln><p>hospital staff thought that they would have taken the </p>
<ln>162</ln><p>proper precautions to prevent the spread of disease and 5% </p>
<ln>163</ln><p>of HS thought that they would have done both. Nearly 94% </p>
<ln>164</ln><p>respondents (HS=100% & GP=90%) used tissue or </p>
<ln>165</ln><p>handkerchief while sneezing or coughing and when the </p>
<ln>166</ln><p>respondents had to visit some swine flu infected area then </p>
<ln>167</ln><p>40% (HS= 60% & GP=26.67%) wash their hands with soap </p>
<ln>168</ln><p>and water more frequently and thoroughly while 40% </p>
<ln>169</ln><p>(HS=30% & GP=46.67%) respondents avoid contact with the </p>
<ln>170</ln><p>people who appeared sick and 30% (HS=40% & GP=23.33%) </p>
<ln>171</ln><p>followed the both precautions. </p>
<ln>172</ln><heading>Discussion </heading>
<ln>173</ln><p>In spite of the increase in the number of Influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<ln>174</ln><p>cases as well as the response of the WHO by raising its </p>
<ln>175</ln><p>pandemic alert status to phase 6 and extensive media </p>
<ln>176</ln><p>coverage, public responses to Influenza A (H1N1) were </p>
<ln>177</ln><p>muted. In practice, convincing the public that the threat is </p>
<ln>178</ln><p>real is often a more pressing task for public health agencies </p>
<ln>179</ln><p>than providing reassurance. 7 Many reports have examined </p>
<ln>180</ln><p>the various levels of knowledge about infectious agents and </p>
<ln>181</ln><p>public behavior in relation to these infections; such studies </p>
<ln>182</ln><p>have primarily focused on the SARS and avian influenza </p>
<ln>183</ln><p>outbreaks.8, 13 Other studies have been recently published </p>
<ln>184</ln><p>specifically on behavioral and attitudinal responses to </p>
<ln>185</ln><p>pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza.10, 14-16 </p>
<ln>186</ln><pagenumber>615 </pagenumber>
<ln>187</ln><p>second wave of swine flu epidemic but 72% of GP were not </p>
<ln>188</ln><p>aware of it. </p>
<ln>189</ln><heading>Attitude response </heading>
<ln>190</ln><p>Only 10% of HS and GP had attended some type of </p>
<ln>191</ln><p>awareness program for swine flu control. Nearly 65% </p>
<ln>192</ln><p>(HS=65% & GP=66.67%) did not avoid public gatherings like </p>
<ln>193</ln><p>parties and group meetings of the fear of swine flu while </p>
<ln>194</ln><p>rest 35% avoid such meetings. Nearly 70% of respondents </p>
<ln>195</ln><p>(HS=65% & GP=73.33%) definitely thought that mask </p>
<ln>196</ln><p>prevents the disease and 20% (HS=30% & GP=13.33%) </p>
<ln>197</ln><p>thought that it was partially true and only 10% (HS=5% & </p>
<ln>198</ln><p>GP=13.33%) didn’t know the answer. </p>
<ln>199</ln><header>Australasian Medical Journal AMJ 2010, 3, 9, 614-617 </header>
<ln>200</ln><p>In our study nearly 75% of the respondents had never heard </p>
<ln>201</ln><p>of the swine flu before out of which 99.33% were of general </p>
<ln>202</ln><p>population and only 0.67% were of medical staff. Out of </p>
<ln>203</ln><p>which 52% knew more than three symptoms. In another </p>
<ln>204</ln><p>study by Kamate et al 83% of subjects had heard about </p>
<ln>205</ln><p>swine flu.17 In another study 44% of national sample of adult </p>
<ln>206</ln><p>Australians reported having knowledge of the term </p>
<ln>207</ln><p>pandemic influenza,18 a finding similar to that of a study </p>
<ln>208</ln><p>conducted in the USA in 2006 in which 41% of respondents </p>
<ln>209</ln><p>had previously heard of this term.7 So here we conclude </p>
<ln>210</ln><p>that our respondents have far less knowledge about swine </p>
<ln>211</ln><p>flu than the above studies and the reason may be lack of </p>
<ln>212</ln><p>public health communications. </p>
<ln>213</ln><p>In our study nearly 72 % of respondents learned about </p>
<ln>214</ln><p>swine flu from television while about 20% came to know </p>
<ln>215</ln><p>about the disease in newspapers and only 8% through word </p>
<ln>216</ln><p>of mouth. Similarly in an another study the majority (84.2%) </p>
<ln>217</ln><p>of the participants received their information about swine </p>
<ln>218</ln><p>flu from the television; 51.1% received information from </p>
<ln>219</ln><p>written media such as newspapers and magazines, while </p>
<ln>220</ln><p>48.2% received information from the internet.19 </p>
<ln>221</ln><p>In a recent review of behavioural responses to influenza </p>
<ln>222</ln><p>pandemics in the 20th century,20 </p>
<ln>223</ln><p>the only two measures </p>
<ln>224</ln><p>that had strong support by scientific literature to lessen the </p>
<ln>225</ln><p>spread of the diseases were hand hygiene and respiratory </p>
<ln>226</ln><p>etiquette. School closure and screening of travellers had </p>
<ln>227</ln><p>legal and ethical consequences when implemented. While </p>
<ln>228</ln><p>the other four measures, including isolation and wearing of </p>
<ln>229</ln><p>a surgical mask or an N95 mask, had cost effectiveness </p>
<ln>230</ln><p>concerns and would be difficult to implement over long </p>
<ln>231</ln><p>periods of time.21, 22 Maximum of the respondents (86%) </p>
<ln>232</ln><p>thought that swine flu can be spread by poor hygiene like </p>
<ln>233</ln><p>touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands </p>
<ln>234</ln><p>and actually 98% of respondents washed their hands before </p>
<ln>235</ln><p>meals while nearly 94% use tissue or handkerchief while </p>
<ln>236</ln><p>coughing or sneezing. In another study nearly, one-third </p>
<ln>237</ln><p>reported avoiding touching their eyes, nose, or mouth </p>
<ln>238</ln><p>(36.6%) and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue </p>
<ln>239</ln><p>when coughing or sneezing (38.0%). However, only one- </p>
<ln>240</ln><p>fourth of participants reported throwing the tissue in the </p>
<ln>241</ln><p>trash after use (26.9%) and avoiding normal activities if they </p>
<ln>242</ln><p>have flulike symptoms (25.7%).17 </p>
<ln>243</ln><p>It is important to know what proportion of the population is </p>
<ln>244</ln><p>concerned about contracting a disease since those who are </p>
<ln>245</ln><p>concerned would be expected to take more precautions. In </p>
<ln>246</ln><p>a telephone-assisted survey of 2,081 adults above the age </p>
<ln>247</ln><p>of 16 years, the New South Wales Department of Health </p>
<ln>248</ln><p>found that only 48.3% of those interviewed were willing to </p>
<ln>249</ln><p>comply with precautionary measures.23,24 </p>
<ln>250</ln><p>reduced the use of public transportation; 74.3% had not </p>
<ln>251</ln><p>taken any time off work; However, more than half the </p>
<ln>252</ln><p>respondents (52.6%; 416/791) avoided crowded places and </p>
<ln>253</ln><p>54.6% washed their hands with soap and water more often </p>
<ln>254</ln><p>than usual, and 63.6% were not overtly worried about </p>
<ln>255</ln><p>cleaning or disinfecting things that they might touch.17 </p>
<ln>256</ln><p>Nearly 70% of the respondents believed that using masks </p>
<ln>257</ln><p>definitely prevents swine flu while 20% were not sure </p>
<ln>258</ln><p>whether masks could prevent from the disease and 10% </p>
<ln>259</ln><p>didn’t knew the answer. Nearly 34% disposed the used </p>
<ln>260</ln><p>mask by throwing it into dustbin, 20% disposed them by </p>
<ln>261</ln><p>burning and 46% did not know how to dispose the masks. In </p>
<ln>262</ln><p>another study the willingness to wear a mask during a </p>
<ln>263</ln><p>pandemic was surprisingly high (95%), particularly as this is </p>
<ln>264</ln><p>not common practice in Australia.18 Use of masks by the </p>
<ln>265</ln><p>general public in China, Hong Kong, Special Administrative </p>
<ln>266</ln><p>Region, during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome </p>
<ln>267</ln><p>(SARS) outbreak was below this level.22 </p>
<ln>268</ln><p>Eighty percent of our respondents definitely thought that </p>
<ln>269</ln><p>the disease was controllable while 10% thought that this </p>
<ln>270</ln><p>was partially true while in an another study two percent of </p>
<ln>271</ln><p>the respondents were of the opinion that Influenza A </p>
<ln>272</ln><p>(H1N1) would not affect their health; 36.4% feared that </p>
<ln>273</ln><p>they would be somewhat affected; 34.5% believed that they </p>
<ln>274</ln><p>would be seriously affected; and 27.1% had no idea about </p>
<ln>275</ln><p>the effect of Influenza A (H1N1) on their health.17 </p>
