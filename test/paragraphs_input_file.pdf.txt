<heading>Chapter 1. </heading>
<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in </p>
<p>possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. </p>
<p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man </p>
<p>may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so </p>
<p>well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is </p>
<p>considered the rightful property of some one or other of their </p>
<p>daughters. </p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have </p>
<p>you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. </p>
<p>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, </p>
<p>and she told me all about it." </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer. </p>
<p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his </p>
<p>wife impatiently. </p>
<p>"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing </p>
<p>it." </p>
<p>This was invitation enough. </p>
<p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that </p>
<p>Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the </p>
<p>north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise </p>
<p>and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, </p>
<p>that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take </p>
<p>possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to </p>
<p>be in the house by the end of next week." </p>
<p>"What is his name?" </p>
<p>"Bingley." </p>
<p>"Is he married or single?" </p>
<p>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large </p>
<p>fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our </p>
<p>girls!" </p>
<p>"How so? How can it affect them?" </p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be </p>
<p>so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his </p>
<p>marrying one of them." </p>
<p>"Is that his design in settling here?" </p>
<p>"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very </p>
<p>likely that he MAY fall in love with one of them, and </p>
<p>therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes." </p>
<p>"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or </p>
<p>you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still </p>
<p>better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley may like you the best of the party." </p>
<p>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly HAVE had my share </p>
<p>of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary </p>
<p>now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought </p>
<p>to give over thinking of her own beauty." </p>
<p>"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to </p>
<p>think of." </p>
<p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley </p>
<p>when he comes into the neighbourhood." </p>
<p>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you." </p>
<p>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an </p>
<p>establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and </p>
<p>Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for </p>
<p>in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you </p>
<p>must go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do </p>
<p>not." </p>
<p>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley </p>
<p>will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by </p>
<p>you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying </p>
<p>whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a </p>
<p>good word for my little Lizzy." </p>
<p>"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better </p>
<p>than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as </p>
<p>Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always </p>
<p>giving her the preference." </p>
<p>"They have none of them much to recommend them," </p>
<p>replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but </p>
<p>Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters." </p>
<p>"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in </p>
<p>such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no </p>
<p>compassion for my poor nerves." </p>
<p>"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your </p>
<p>nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention </p>
<p>them with consideration these last twenty years at least." </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic </p>
<p>humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and </p>
<p>twenty </p>
<p>years had been insufficient to make his wife </p>
<p>understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to </p>
<p>develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little </p>
<p>information, and uncertain temper. When she was </p>
<p>discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her </p>
<p>life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting </p>
<p>and news. </p>
<heading>Chapter 2. </heading>
<p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to </p>
<p>the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till </p>
<p>the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of </p>
<p>it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing </p>
<p>his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly </p>
<p>addressed her with: </p>
<p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy." </p>
<p>"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," </p>
<p>said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit." </p>
<p>"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall </p>
<p>meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to </p>
<p>introduce him." </p>
<p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She </p>
<p>has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical </p>
<p>woman, and I have no opinion of her." </p>
<p>"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find </p>
<p>that you do not depend on her serving you." </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to </p>
<p>contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. </p>
<p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a </p>
<p>little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces." </p>
<p>"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; </p>
<p>"she times them ill." </p>
<p>"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty </p>
<p>fretfully. "When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?" </p>
<p>"To-morrow fortnight." </p>
<p>"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not </p>
<p>come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her </p>
<p>to introduce him, for she will not know him herself." </p>
<p>"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your </p>
<p>friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her." </p>
<p>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not </p>
<p>acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?" </p>
<p>"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance </p>
<p>is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is </p>
<p>by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody </p>
<p>else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must </p>
<p>stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of </p>
<p>kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself." </p>
<p>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, </p>
<p>"Nonsense, nonsense!" </p>
<p>"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" </p>
<p>cried he. "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the </p>
<p>stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree </p>
<p>with you there. What say you, Mary? For you are a young </p>
<p>lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and </p>
<p>make extracts." </p>
<p>Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how. </p>
<p>"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us </p>
<p>return to Mr. Bingley." </p>
<p>"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife. </p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that </p>
<p>before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly </p>
<p>would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have </p>
<p>actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance </p>
<p>now." </p>
<p>The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; </p>
<p>that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when </p>
<p>the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it </p>
<p>was what she had expected all the while. </p>
<p>"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew </p>
<p>I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls </p>
<p>too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I </p>
<p>am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone </p>
<p>this morning and never said a word about it till now." </p>
<p>"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with </p>
<p>the raptures of his wife. </p>
<p>"What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when </p>
<p>the door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make </p>
<p>him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At </p>
<p>our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be </p>
<p>making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we </p>
<p>would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the </p>
<p>youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the </p>
<p>next ball." </p>
<p>"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I am </p>
<p>the youngest, I'm the tallest." </p>
<p>The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how </p>
<p>soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining </p>
<p>when they should ask him to dinner. </p>
<heading>Chapter 3. </heading>
<p>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of </p>
<p>her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to </p>
<p>draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley. They attacked him in various ways--with barefaced </p>
<p>questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he </p>
<p>eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to </p>
<p>accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady </p>
<p>Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had </p>
<p>been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully </p>
<p>handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he </p>
<p>meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing </p>
<p>could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain </p>
<p>step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley's heart were entertained. </p>
<p>"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at </p>
<p>Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the </p>
<p>others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for." </p>
<p>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and </p>
<p>sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had </p>
<p>entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young </p>
<p>ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only </p>
<p>the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they </p>
<p>had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that </p>
<p>he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse. </p>
<p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; </p>
<p>and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to </p>
<p>do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which </p>
<p>deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the </p>
<p>following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour </p>
<p>of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. </p>
<p>She could not imagine what business he could have in town so </p>
<p>soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear </p>
<p>that he might be always flying about from one place to </p>
<p>another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. </p>
<p>Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his </p>
<p>being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; </p>
<p>and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring </p>
<p>twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. </p>
<p>The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were </p>
<p>comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of </p>
<p>twelve he brought only six with him from London--his five </p>
<p>sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly </p>
<p>room it consisted of only five altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two </p>
<p>sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man. </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had </p>
<p>a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His </p>
<p>sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His </p>
<p>brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but </p>
<p>his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by </p>
<p>his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the </p>
<p>report which was in general circulation within five minutes </p>
<p>after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The </p>
<p>gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the </p>
<p>ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, </p>
<p>and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the </p>
<p>evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide </p>
<p>of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be </p>
<p>above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his </p>
<p>large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a </p>
<p>most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being </p>
<p>unworthy to be compared with his friend. </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the </p>
<p>principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, </p>
<p>danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, </p>
<p>and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable </p>
<p>qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between </p>
<p>him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. </p>
<p>Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced </p>
<p>to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking </p>
<p>about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own </p>
<p>party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most </p>
<p>disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he </p>
<p>would never come there again. Amongst the most violent </p>
<p>against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general </p>
<p>behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his </p>
<p>having slighted one of her daughters. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of </p>
<p>gentle men, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that </p>
<p>time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear </p>
<p>a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from </p>
<p>the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. </p>
<p>"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to </p>
<p>see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You </p>
<p>had much better dance." </p>
<p>"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I </p>
<p>am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an </p>
<p>assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are </p>
<p>engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it </p>
<p>would not be a punishment to me to stand up with." </p>
<p>"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with </p>
<p>so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and </p>
<p>there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty." </p>
<p>"You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the </p>
<p>room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. </p>
<p>"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But </p>
<p>there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is </p>
<p>very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my </p>
<p>partner to introduce you." </p>
<p>"Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a </p>
<p>moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his </p>
<p>own and coldly said: "She is tolerable, but not handsome </p>
<p>enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give </p>
<p>consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. </p>
<p>You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for </p>
<p>you are wasting your time with me." </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; </p>
<p>and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward </p>
<p>him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her </p>
<p>friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which </p>
<p>delighted in anything ridiculous. </p>
<p>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole </p>
<p>family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much </p>
<p>admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced </p>
<p>with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. </p>
<p>Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, </p>
<p>though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary </p>
<p>had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most </p>
<p>accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and </p>
<p>Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, </p>
<p>which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. </p>
<p>They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the </p>
<p>village where they lived, and of which they were the principal </p>
<p>inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he </p>
<p>was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a </p>
<p>good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which </p>
<p>had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped </p>
<p>that his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; </p>
<p>but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear. </p>
<p>"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we </p>
<p>have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I </p>
<p>wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could </p>
<p>be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her </p>
<p>twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with </p>
<p>her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he </p>
<p>asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was </p>
<p>so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did </p>
<p>not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he </p>
<p>seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the </p>
<p>dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and </p>
<p>asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with </p>
<p>Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two </p>
<p>fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the </p>
<heading>boulanger--" </heading>
<p>"If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband </p>
<p>impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For </p>
<p>God's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had </p>
<p>sprained his ankle in the first place!" </p>
<p>"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so </p>
<p>excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I </p>
<p>never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. </p>
<p>I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown--" </p>
<p>Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested </p>
<p>against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to </p>
<p>seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much </p>
<p>bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking </p>
<p>rudeness of Mr. Darcy. </p>
<p>"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not </p>
<p>lose much by not </p>
<p>suiting his fancy; for he is a most </p>
<p>disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high </p>
<p>and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked </p>
<p>here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not </p>
<p>handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, </p>
<p>my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite </p>
<p>detest the man." </p>

<heading>Chapter 4. </heading>
<p>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had </p>
<p>been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed </p>
<p>to her sister just how very much she admired him. </p>
<p>"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, </p>
<p>"sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy </p>
<p>man-ners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" </p>
<p>"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young </p>
<p>man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is </p>
<p>thereby complete." </p>
<p>"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a </p>
<p>second time. I did not expect such a compliment." </p>
<p>"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great </p>
<p>difference between us. Compliments always take you by </p>
<p>surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his </p>
<p>asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were </p>
<p>about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. </p>
<p>No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very </p>
<p>agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked </p>
<p>many a stupider person." </p>
<p>"Dear Lizzy!" </p>
<p>"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people </p>
<p>in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are </p>
<p>good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill </p>
<p>of a human being in your life." </p>
<p>"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I </p>
<p>always speak what I think." </p>
<p>"I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. </p>
<p>With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies </p>
<p>and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common </p>
<p>enough--one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid </p>
<p>without ostentation or design--to take the good of everybody's </p>
<p>character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad- </p>
<p>belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too, </p>
<p>do you? Their manners are not equal to his." </p>
<p>"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women </p>
<p>when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with </p>
<p>her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if </p>
<p>we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her." </p>
<p>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their </p>
<p>behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in </p>
<p>general; and with more quickness of observation and less </p>
<p>pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too </p>
<p>unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little </p>
<p>disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; </p>
<p>not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in </p>
<p>the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, </p>
<p>but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had </p>
<p>been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, </p>
<p>had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of </p>
<p>spending more than they ought, and of associating with </p>
<p>people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to </p>
<p>think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of </p>
<p>a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance </p>
<p>more deeply impressed on their memories than that their </p>
<p>brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a </p>
<p>hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended </p>
<p>to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley </p>
<p>intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his </p>
<p>county; but as he was now provided with a good house and </p>
<p>the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who </p>
<p>best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not </p>
<p>spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the </p>
<p>next generation to purchase. </p>
<p>His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his </p>
<p>own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, </p>
<p>Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his </p>
<p>table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more </p>
<p>fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as </p>
<p>her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age </p>
<p>two years, when he was tempted by an accidental </p>
<p>recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at </p>
<p>it, and into it for half-an hour--was pleased with the situation </p>
<p>and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in </p>
<p>its praise, and took it immediately. </p>
<p>Between him and Darcy there was a very steady </p>
<p>friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley </p>
<p>was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and </p>
<p>ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a </p>
<p>greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never </p>
<p>appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, </p>
<p>Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the </p>
<p>highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. </p>
<p>Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He </p>
<p>was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and </p>
<p>his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that </p>
<p>respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure </p>
<p>of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually </p>
<p>giving offense. </p>
<p>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly </p>
<p>was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with </p>
<p>more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody </p>
<p>had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no </p>
<p>formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the </p>
<p>room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel </p>
<p>more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection </p>
<p>of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for </p>
<p>none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none </p>
<p>received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he </p>
<p>acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much. </p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they </p>
<p>admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet </p>
<p>girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. </p>
<p>Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and </p>
<p>their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of </p>
<p>her as he chose. </p>

<heading>Chapter 5. </heading>
<p>Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with </p>
<p>whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William </p>
<p>Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had </p>
<p>made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour </p>
<p>of </p>
<p>knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. </p>
<p>The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had </p>
<p>given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a </p>
<p>small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had </p>
<p>removed with his family to a house about a mile from </p>
<p>Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where </p>
<p>he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, </p>
<p>unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil </p>
<p>to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not </p>
<p>render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention </p>
<p>to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, </p>
<p>his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous. </p>
<p>Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too </p>
<p>clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had </p>
<p>several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent </p>
<p>young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate </p>
<p>friend. </p>
<p>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet </p>
<p>to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning </p>
<p>after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear </p>
<p>and to communicate. </p>
<p>"You began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. "You were Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley's first choice." </p>
<p>"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better." </p>
<p>"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with </p>
<p>her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her- </p>
<p>indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it-but I </p>
<p>hardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson." </p>
<p>"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. </p>
<p>Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking </p>
<p>him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did </p>
<p>not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, </p>
<p>and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering </p>
<p>immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, </p>
<p>beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'" </p>
<p>"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that </p>
<p>does seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you </p>
<p>know." </p>
<p>"My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, </p>
<p>Eliza," said Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth </p>
<p>listening to as his friend, is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just </p>
<heading>tolerable." </heading>
<p>"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed </p>
<p>by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it </p>
<p>would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long </p>
<p>told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour </p>
<p>without once opening his lips." </p>
<p>"Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" </p>
<p>said Jane. "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her." </p>
<p>"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked </p>
<p>Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said </p>
<p>he seemed quite angry at being spoke to." </p>
<p>"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks </p>
<p>much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he </p>
<p>is remarkably agreeable." </p>
<p>"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so </p>
<p>very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can </p>
<p>guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, </p>
<p>and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not </p>
<p>keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise." </p>
<p>"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss </p>
<p>Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza." </p>
<p>"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance </p>
<p>with him, if I were you." </p>
<p>"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance </p>
<p>with him." </p>
<p>"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend me so much </p>
<p>as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One </p>
<p>cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, </p>
<p>fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of </p>
<p>himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud." </p>
<p>"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily </p>
<p>forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine." </p>
<p>"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the </p>
<p>solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing, I </p>
<p>believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is </p>
<p>very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone </p>
<p>to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a </p>
<p>feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or </p>
<p>other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, </p>
<p>though the words are often used synonymously. A person may </p>
<p>be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion </p>
<p>of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of </p>
<p>us." </p>
<p>"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who </p>
<p>came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I </p>
<p>would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a </p>
<p>day." </p>
<p>"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," </p>
<p>said Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take </p>
<p>away your bottle directly." </p>
<p>The boy protested that she should not; she continued to </p>
<p>declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the </p>
<p>visit. </p>

<heading>Chapter 6. </heading>
<p>The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of </p>
<p>Netherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss </p>
<p>Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. </p>
<p>Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to </p>
<p>be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a </p>
<p>wish of being better acquainted with THEM was expressed </p>
<p>towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received </p>
<p>with the greatest pleasure, but </p>
<p>Elizabeth still saw </p>
<p>superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly </p>
<p>excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though </p>
<p>their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in </p>
<p>all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. </p>
<p>It was generally evident whenever they met, that he DID </p>
<p>admire her and to HER it was equally evident that Jane was </p>
<p>yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain </p>
<p>for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in </p>
<p>love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to </p>
<p>be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with </p>
<p>great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a </p>
<p>uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from </p>
<p>the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her </p>
<p>friend Miss Lucas. </p>
<p>"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able </p>
<p>to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a </p>
<p>disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her </p>
<p>affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may </p>
<p>lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor </p>
<p>consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is </p>
<p>so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, </p>
<p>that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all BEGIN </p>
<p>freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are </p>
<p>very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love </p>
<p>without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had </p>
<p>better show MORE affection than she feels. Bingley likes </p>
<p>your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like </p>
<p>her, if she does not help him on." </p>
<p>"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will </p>
<p>allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a </p>
<p>simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too." </p>
<p>"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's </p>
<p>disposition as you do." </p>
<p>"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not </p>
<p>endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out." </p>
<p>"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though </p>
<p>Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many </p>
<p>hours together; and, as they always see each other in large </p>
<p>mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be </p>
<p>employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make </p>
<p>the most of every half-hour in which she can command his </p>
<p>attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more </p>
<p>leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses." </p>
<p>"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where noth </p>
<p>ing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I </p>
<p>were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare </p>
<p>say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is </p>
<p>not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the </p>
<p>degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has </p>
<p>known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him </p>
<p>at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and </p>
<p>has since dined with him in company four times. This is not </p>
<p>quite enough to make her understand his character." </p>
<p>"Not as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, </p>
<p>she might only have discovered whether he had a good </p>
<p>appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also </p>
<p>been spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal." </p>
<p>"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain </p>
<p>that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with </p>
<p>respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine </p>
<p>that much has been unfolded." </p>
<p>"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my </p>
<p>heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should </p>
<p>think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to </p>
<p>be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in </p>
<p>marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of </p>
<p>the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so </p>
<p>similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the </p>
<p>least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike </p>
<p>afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to </p>
<p>know as little as possible of the defects of the person with </p>
<p>whom you are to pass your life." </p>
<p>"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You </p>
<p>know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way </p>
<p>yourself." </p>
<p>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her </p>
<p>sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself </p>
<p>becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he </p>
<p>had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when </p>
<p>they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner </p>
<p>had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly </p>
<p>had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was </p>
<p>rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression </p>
<p>of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others </p>
<p>equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye </p>
<p>more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was </p>
<p>forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and </p>
<p>in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the </p>
<p>fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. </p>
<p>Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man </p>
<p>who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not </p>
<p>thought her handsome enough to dance with. </p>
<p>He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step </p>
<p>towards conversing with </p>
<p>her himself, attended </p>
<p>to </p>
<p>her </p>
<p>conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was </p>
<p>at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled. </p>
<p>"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by </p>
<p>listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?" </p>
<p>"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer." </p>
<p>"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know </p>
<p>that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I </p>
<p>do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow </p>
<p>afraid of him." </p>
<p>On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without </p>
<p>seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied </p>
<p>her friend to mention such a subject to him; which </p>
<p>immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him </p>
<p>and said: </p>
<p>"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself </p>
<p>uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel </p>
<p>Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?" </p>
<p>"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes </p>
<p>a lady energetic." </p>
<p>"You are severe on us." </p>
<p>"It will be HER turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. </p>
<p>"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what </p>
<p>follows." </p>
<p>"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!-- </p>
<p>always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and </p>
<p>everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would </p>
<p>have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit </p>
<p>down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the </p>
<p>very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, </p>
<p>she added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely </p>
<p>glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which </p>
<p>everybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath </p>
<p>to cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my </p>
<p>song." </p>
<p>Her performance was pleasing, though by no means </p>
<p>capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the </p>
<p>entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was </p>
<p>eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who </p>
<p>having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the </p>
<p>family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, </p>
<p>was always impatient for display. </p>
<p>Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had </p>
<p>given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air </p>
<p>and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher </p>
<p>degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy </p>
<p>and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, </p>
<p>though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a </p>
<p>long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by </p>
<p>Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, </p>
<p>who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, </p>
<p>joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room. </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a </p>
<p>mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all </p>
<p>conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to </p>
<p>perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir </p>
<p>William thus began: </p>
<p>"What a charming amusement for young people this is, </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider </p>
<p>it as one of the first refinements of polished society." </p>
<p>"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in </p>
<p>vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every </p>
<p>savage can dance." </p>
<p>Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs </p>
<p>delightfully," he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley </p>
<p>join the group; "and I doubt not that you are an adept in the </p>
<p>science yourself, Mr. Darcy." </p>
<p>"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir." </p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure </p>
<p>from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?" </p>
<p>"Never, sir." </p>
<p>"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the </p>
<p>place?" </p>
<p>"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can </p>
<p>avoid it." </p>
<p>"You have a house in town, I conclude?" </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy bowed. </p>
<p>"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself-for </p>
<p>I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain </p>
<p>that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas." </p>
<p>He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was </p>
<p>not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant </p>
<p>moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing </p>
<p>a very gallant thing, and called out to her: </p>
<p>"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as </p>
<p>a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am </p>
<p>sure when so much beauty is before you." And, taking her </p>
<p>hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though </p>
<p>extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she </p>
<p>instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir </p>
<p>William: </p>
<p>"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I </p>
<p>entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to </p>
<p>beg for a partner." </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed </p>
<p>the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; </p>
<p>nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at </p>
<p>persuasion. </p>
<p>"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is </p>
<p>cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this </p>
<p>gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no </p>
<p>objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour." </p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling. </p>
<p>"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear </p>
<p>Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who </p>
<p>would object to such a partner?" </p>
<p>Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance </p>
<p>had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking </p>
<p>of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss </p>
<p>Bingley: </p>
<p>"I can guess the subject of your reverie." </p>
<p>"I should imagine not." </p>
<p>"You are considering how insupportable it would be to </p>
<p>pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and </p>
<p>indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! </p>
<p>The insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the </p>
<p>self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear </p>
<p>your strictures on them!" </p>
<p>"You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind </p>
<p>was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the </p>
<p>very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a </p>
<p>pretty woman can bestow." </p>
<p>Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and </p>
<p>desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring </p>
<p>such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity: </p>
<p>"Miss Elizabeth Bennet." </p>
<p>"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all </p>
<p>astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?--and </p>
<p>pray, when am I to wish you joy?" </p>
<p>"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. </p>
<p>A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration </p>
<p>to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you </p>
<p>would be wishing me joy." </p>
<p>"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter </p>
<p>is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming motherin- </p>
<p>law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley </p>
<p>with you." </p>
<p>He listened to her with perfect indifference while she </p>
<p>chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his </p>
<p>composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed </p>
<p>long. </p>

<heading>Chapter 7. </heading>
<p>Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate </p>
<p>of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his </p>
<p>daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant </p>
<p>relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her </p>
<p>situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her </p>
<p>father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four </p>
<p>thousand pounds. </p>
<p>She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a </p>
<p>clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a </p>
<p>brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade. </p>
<p>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from </p>
<p>Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, </p>
<p>who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, </p>
<p>to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over </p>
<p>the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and </p>
<p>Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their </p>
<p>minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing </p>
<p>better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse </p>
<p>their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; </p>
<p>and however bare of news the country in general might be, </p>
<p>they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At </p>
<p>present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and </p>
<p>happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the </p>
<p>neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and </p>
<p>Meryton was the headquarters. </p>
<p>Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the </p>
<p>most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to </p>
<p>their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their </p>
<p>lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to </p>
<p>know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, </p>
<p>and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown </p>
<p>before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation </p>
<p>to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to </p>
<p>the regimentals of an ensign. </p>
<p>After listening one morning to their effusions on this </p>
<p>subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed: </p>
<p>"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you </p>
<p>must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have </p>
<p>suspected it some time, but I am now convinced." </p>
<p>Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but </p>
<p>Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her </p>
<p>admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in </p>
<p>the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to </p>
<p>London. </p>
<p>"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you </p>
<p>should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I </p>
<p>wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should </p>
<p>not be of my own, however." </p>
<p>"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible </p>
<p>of it." </p>
<p>"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever." </p>
<p>"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not </p>
<p>agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every </p>
<p>particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two </p>
<p>youngest daughters uncommonly foolish." </p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to </p>
<p>have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to </p>
<p>our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more </p>
<p>than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat </p>
<p>myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if </p>
<p>a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, </p>
<p>should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I </p>
<p>thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night </p>
<p>at Sir William's in his regimentals." </p>
<p>"Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster </p>
<p>and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as </p>
<p>they did when they first came; she sees them now very often </p>
<p>standing in Clarke's library." </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the </p>
<p>footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from </p>
<p>Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly </p>
<p>calling out, while her daughter read, </p>
<p>"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does </p>
<p>he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my </p>
<p>love." </p>
<p>"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud. </p>
<p>"MY DEAR FRIEND,- </p>
<p>"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with </p>
<p>Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for </p>
<p>the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two </p>
<p>women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you </p>
<p>can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to </p>
<p>dine with the officers.--Yours ever, </p>
<p>"CAROLINE BINGLEY" </p>
<p>"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did </p>
<p>not tell us of THAT." </p>
<p>"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky." </p>
<p>"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane. </p>
<p>"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it </p>
<p>seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night." </p>
<p>"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you </p>
<p>were sure that they would not offer to send her home." </p>
<p>"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to </p>
<p>go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs." </p>
<p>"I had much rather go in the coach." </p>
<p>"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am </p>
<p>sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?" </p>
<p>"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get </p>
<p>them." </p>
<p>"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my </p>
<p>mother's purpose will be answered." </p>
<p>She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment </p>
<p>that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go </p>
<p>on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with </p>
<p>many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were </p>
<p>answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. </p>
<p>Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. </p>
<p>The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; </p>
<p>Jane certainly could not come back. </p>
<p>"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her </p>
<p>own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all </p>
<p>the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over </p>
<p>when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note </p>
<p>for Elizabeth: </p>
<p>"MY DEAREST LIZZY,- </p>
<p>"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, </p>
<p>is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My </p>
<p>kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. </p>
<p>They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not </p>
<p>be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me-- </p>
<p>and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not </p>
<p>much the matter with me.--Yours, etc." </p>
<p>"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had </p>
<p>read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a </p>
<p>dangerous fit of illness--if she should die, it would be a </p>
<p>comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and </p>
<p>under your orders." </p>
<p>"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of </p>
<p>little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as </p>
<p>she stays there, it is all very well. I would go an see her if I </p>
<p>could have the carriage." </p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to </p>
<p>her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no </p>
<p>horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared </p>
<p>her resolution. </p>
<p>"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of </p>
<p>such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen </p>
<p>when you get there." </p>
<p>"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want." </p>
<p>"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for </p>
<p>the horses?" </p>
<p>"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance </p>
<p>is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be </p>
<p>back by dinner." </p>
<p>"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed </p>
<p>Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by </p>
<p>reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in </p>
<p>proportion to what is required." </p>
<p>"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine </p>
<p>and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three </p>
<p>young ladies set off together. </p>
<p>"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, </p>
<p>"perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he </p>
<p>goes." </p>
<p>In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the </p>
<p>lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued </p>
<p>her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jump </p>
<p>ing over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient </p>
<p>activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, </p>
<p>with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with </p>
<p>the warmth of exercise. </p>
<p>She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but </p>
<p>Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a </p>
<p>great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three </p>
<p>miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by </p>
<p>herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss </p>
<p>Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in </p>
<p>contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by </p>
<p>them; and in their brother's manners there was something </p>
<p>better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The </p>
<p>former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy </p>
<p>which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to </p>
<p>the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter </p>
<p>was thinking only of his breakfast. </p>
<p>Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably </p>
<p>answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very </p>
<p>feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth </p>
<p>was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had </p>
<p>only been </p>
<p>withheld by the fear of giving alarm </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she </p>
<p>longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was </p>
<p>not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss </p>
<p>Bingley left them together, could </p>
<p>attempt little besides </p>
<p>expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she </p>
<p>was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her. </p>
<p>When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; </p>
<p>and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how </p>
<p>much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The </p>
<p>apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as </p>
<p>might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and </p>
<p>that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to </p>
<p>return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice </p>
<p>was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, </p>
<p>and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room </p>
<p>for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the </p>
<p>gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do </p>
<p>elsewhere. </p>
<p>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must </p>
<p>go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the </p>
<p>carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, </p>
<p>when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss </p>
<p>Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an </p>
<p>invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth </p>
<p>most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to </p>
<p>Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back </p>
<p>a supply of clothes. </p>
<heading>Chapter 8. </heading>
<p>At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half- </p>
<p>past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil </p>
<p>inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had </p>
<p>the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. </p>
<p>Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, </p>
<p>repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, </p>
<p>how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively </p>
<p>they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more </p>
<p>of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not </p>
<p>immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment </p>
<p>of all her former dislike. </p>
<p>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom </p>
<p>she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane </p>
<p>was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and </p>
<p>they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she </p>
<p>believed she was considered by the others. She had very little </p>
<p>notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by </p>
<p>whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only </p>
<p>to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to </p>
<p>prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her. </p>
<p>When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and </p>
<p>Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the </p>
<p>room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a </p>
<p>mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, </p>
<p>no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added: </p>
<p>"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an </p>
<p>excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this </p>
<p>morning. She really looked almost wild." </p>
<p>"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my </p>
<p>countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must SHE </p>
<p>be scampering about the country, because her sister had a </p>
<p>cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!" </p>
<p>"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six </p>
<p>inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown </p>
<p>which had been let down to hide it not doing its office." </p>
<p>"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; </p>
<p>"but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth </p>
<p>Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room </p>
<p>this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice." </p>
<p>"YOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss </p>
<p>Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish </p>
<p>to see YOUR sister make such an exhibition." </p>
<p>"Certainly not." </p>
<p>"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or </p>
<p>whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! </p>
<p>What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an </p>
<p>abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country- </p>
<p>town indifference to decorum." </p>
<p>"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," </p>
<p>said Bingley. </p>
<p>"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half </p>
<p>whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your </p>
<p>admiration of her fine eyes." </p>
<p>"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the </p>
<p>exercise." A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst </p>
<p>began again: </p>
<p>"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is </p>
<p>really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were </p>
<p>well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low </p>
<p>connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it." </p>
<p>"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney </p>
<p>on Meryton." </p>
<p>"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near </p>
<p>Cheapside." </p>
<p>"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed </p>
<p>heartily. </p>
<p>"If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside," cried </p>
<p>Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable." </p>
<p>"But it must very materially lessen their chance of </p>
<p>marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied </p>
<p>Darcy. </p>
<p>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters </p>
<p>gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some </p>
<p>time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations. </p>
<p>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to </p>
<p>her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till </p>
<p>summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth </p>
<p>would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had </p>
<p>the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her </p>
<p>rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs </p>
<p>herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole </p>
<p>party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but </p>
<p>suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and </p>
<p>making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for </p>
<p>the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst </p>
<p>looked at her with astonishment. </p>
<p>"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather </p>
<p>singular." </p>
<p>"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. </p>
<p>She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else." </p>
<p>"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried </p>
<p>Elizabeth; "I am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in </p>
<p>many things." </p>
<p>"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said </p>
<p>Bingley; "and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her </p>
<p>quite well." </p>
<p>Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked </p>
<p>towards the table where a few books were lying. He </p>
<p>immediately offered to fetch her others--all that his library </p>
<p>afforded. </p>
<p>"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and </p>
<p>my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not </p>
<p>many, I have more than I ever looked into." </p>
<p>Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly </p>
<p>with those in the room. </p>
<p>"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father </p>
<p>should have left so small a collection of books. What a </p>
<p>delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!" </p>
<p>"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of </p>
<p>many generations." </p>
<p>"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are </p>
<p>always buying books." </p>
<p>"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in </p>
<p>such days as these." </p>
<p>"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the </p>
<p>beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build YOUR </p>
<p>house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley." </p>
<p>"I wish it may." </p>
<p>"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in </p>
<p>that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. </p>
<p>There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire." </p>
<p>"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy </p>
<p>will sell it." </p>
<p>"I am talking of possibilities, Charles." </p>
<p>"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible </p>
<p>to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to </p>
<p>leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it </p>
<p>wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed </p>
<p>herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe </p>
<p>the game. </p>
<p>"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss </p>
<p>Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?" </p>
<p>"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's </p>
<p>height, or rather taller." </p>
<p>"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody </p>
<p>who delighted me </p>
<p>so much. Such a countenance, such </p>
<p>manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her </p>
<p>performance on the pianoforte is exquisite." </p>
<p>"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can </p>
<p>have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are." </p>
<p>"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do </p>
<p>you mean?" </p>
<p>"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover </p>
<p>screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot </p>
<p>do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of </p>
<p>for the first time, without being informed that she was very </p>
<p>accomplished." </p>
<p>"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said </p>
<p>Darcy, "has too much truth. The word is applied to many a </p>
<p>woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse </p>
<p>or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with </p>
<p>you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of </p>
<p>knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my </p>
<p>acquaintance, that are really accomplished." </p>
<p>"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley. </p>
<p>"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great </p>
<p>deal in your idea of an accomplished woman." </p>
<p>"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it." </p>
<p>"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be </p>
<p>really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass </p>
<p>what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough </p>
<p>knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the </p>
<p>modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, </p>
<p>she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of </p>
<p>walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or </p>
<p>the word will be but half-deserved." </p>
<p>"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this </p>
<p>she must yet add something more substantial, in the </p>
<p>improvement of her mind by extensive reading." </p>
<p>"I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six </p>
<p>accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing </p>
<p>ANY." </p>
<p>"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the </p>
<p>possibility of all this?" </p>
<p>"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and </p>
<p>taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united." </p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the </p>
<p>injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that </p>
<p>they knew many women who answered this description, when </p>
<p>Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their </p>
<p>inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation </p>
<p>was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the </p>
<p>room. </p>
<p>"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was </p>
<p>closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to </p>
<p>recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their </p>
<p>own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my </p>
<p>opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art." </p>
<p>"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was </p>
<p>chiefly addressed, "there is a meanness in ALL the arts which </p>
<p>ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. </p>
<p>Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable." </p>
<p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply </p>
<p>as to continue the subject. </p>
<p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was </p>
<p>worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. </p>
<p>Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced </p>
<p>that no country advice could be of any service, recommended </p>
<p>an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. </p>
<p>This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to </p>
<p>comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that </p>
<p>Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss </p>
<p>Bennet were not decidedly better. </p>
<p>Bingley was quite </p>
<p>uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. </p>
<p>They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after </p>
<p>supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than </p>
<p>by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention </p>
<p>might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. </p>

<heading>Chapter 9. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, </p>
<p>and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a </p>
<p>tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received </p>
<p>from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards </p>
<p>from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite </p>
<p>of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent </p>
<p>to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her </p>
<p>own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately </p>
<p>dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached </p>
<p>Netherfield soon after the family breakfast. </p>
<p>Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing </p>
<p>her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her </p>
<p>recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would </p>
<p>probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, </p>
<p>therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; </p>
<p>neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, </p>
<p>think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, </p>
<p>on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and </p>
<p>three daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour. </p>
<p>Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found </p>
<p>Miss Bennet worse than she expected. </p>
<p>"Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal </p>
<p>too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of </p>
<p>moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your </p>
<p>kindness." </p>
<p>"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My </p>
<p>sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal." </p>
<p>"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, </p>
<p>with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet will receive every </p>
<p>possible attention while she remains with us." </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. </p>
<p>"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends </p>
<p>I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill </p>
<p>indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest </p>
<p>patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for </p>
<p>she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever </p>
<p>met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to HER. </p>
<p>You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming </p>
<p>prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the </p>
<p>country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of </p>
<p>quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short </p>
<p>lease." </p>
<p>"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and </p>
<p>therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should </p>
<p>probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I </p>
<p>consider myself as quite fixed here." </p>
<p>"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said </p>
<p>Elizabeth. </p>
<p>"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning </p>
<p>towards her. </p>
<p>"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly." </p>
<p>"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so </p>
<p>easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful." </p>
<p>"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, </p>
<p>intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as </p>
<p>yours." </p>
<p>"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and </p>
<p>do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at </p>
<p>home." </p>
<p>"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, </p>
<p>"that your were a studier of character. It must be an amusing </p>
<p>study." </p>
<p>"Yes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing. They </p>
<p>have at least that advantage." </p>
<p>"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a </p>
<p>few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you </p>
<p>move in a very confined and unvarying society." </p>
<p>"But people themselves alter so much, that there is </p>
<p>something new to be observed in them for ever." </p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner </p>
<p>of mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is </p>
<p>quite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town." </p>
<p>Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her </p>
<p>for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied </p>
<p>she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her </p>
<p>triumph. </p>
<p>"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the </p>
<p>country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The </p>
<p>country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?" </p>
<p>"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to </p>
<p>leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. </p>
<p>They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy </p>
<p>in either." </p>
<p>"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But </p>
<p>that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the </p>
<p>country was nothing at all." </p>
<p>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, </p>
<p>blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He </p>
<p>only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be </p>
<p>met with in the country as in the town, which you must </p>
<p>acknowledge to be true." </p>
<p>"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not </p>
<p>meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe </p>
<p>there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with </p>
<p>four and-twenty families." </p>
<p>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to </p>
<p>keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and </p>
<p>directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive </p>
<p>smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might </p>
<p>turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas </p>
<p>had been at Longbourn since HER coming away. </p>
<p>"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an </p>
<p>agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So </p>
<p>much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He had always </p>
<p>something to say to everybody. THAT is my idea of good </p>
<p>breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very </p>
<p>important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the </p>
<p>matter." </p>
<p>"Did Charlotte dine with you?" </p>
<p>"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the </p>
<p>mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants </p>
<p>that can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up </p>
<p>very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, </p>
<p>and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is </p>
<p>a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so </p>
<p>VERY plain--but then she is our particular friend." </p>
<p>"She seems a very pleasant young woman." </p>
<p>"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady </p>
<p>Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I </p>
<p>do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one </p>
<p>does not often see anybody better looking. It is what </p>
<p>everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she </p>
<p>was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in </p>
<p>town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure </p>
<p>he would make her an offer before we came away. But, </p>
<p>however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. </p>
<p>However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they </p>
<p>were." </p>
<p>"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. </p>
<p>"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same </p>
<p>way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in </p>
<p>driving away love!" </p>
<p>"I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of </p>
<p>love," said Darcy. </p>
<p>"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes </p>
<p>what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of </p>
<p>inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it </p>
<p>entirely away." </p>
<p>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued </p>
<p>made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing </p>
<p>herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing </p>
<p>to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating </p>
<p>her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an </p>
<p>apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was </p>
<p>unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister </p>
<p>to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She </p>
<p>performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her </p>
<p>carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put </p>
<p>herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each </p>
<p>other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the </p>
<p>youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his </p>
<p>first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield. </p>
<p>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine </p>
<p>complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite </p>
<p>with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public </p>
<p>at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of </p>
<p>natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, </p>
<p>to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners </p>
<p>recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very </p>
<p>equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the </p>
<p>ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it </p>
<p>would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not </p>
<p>keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to </p>
<p>their mother's ear: </p>
<p>"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my </p>
<p>engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if </p>
<p>you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not </p>
<p>wish to be dancing when she is ill." </p>
<p>Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes--it would be </p>
<p>much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most </p>
<p>likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when </p>
<p>you have given YOUR ball," she added, "I shall insist on their </p>
<p>giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a </p>
<p>shame if he does not." </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet and her </p>
<p>daughters then departed, </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her </p>
<p>relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on </p>
<p>to join in their censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley's </p>
<p>witticisms on FINE EYES. </p>
<heading>Chapter 10. </heading>
<p>The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. </p>
<p>Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning </p>
<p>with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and </p>
<p>in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing- </p>
<p>room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was </p>
<p>writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the </p>
<p>progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention </p>
<p>by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at </p>
<p>piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game. </p>
<p>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently </p>
<p>amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his </p>
<p>companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either </p>
<p>on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the </p>
<p>length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her </p>
<p>praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was </p>
<p>exactly in union with her opinion of each. </p>
<p>"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a </p>
<p>letter!" </p>
<p>He made no answer. </p>
<p>"You write uncommonly fast." </p>
<p>"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly." </p>
<p>"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the </p>
<p>course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I </p>
<p>should think them!" </p>
<p>"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of </p>
<p>yours." </p>
<p>"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her." </p>
<p>"I have already told her so once, by your desire." </p>
<p>"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for </p>
<p>you. I mend pens remarkably well." </p>
<p>"Thank you--but I always mend my own." </p>
<p>"How can you contrive to write so even?" </p>
<p>He was silent. </p>
<p>"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement </p>
<p>on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures </p>
<p>with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it </p>
<p>infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's." </p>
<p>"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write </p>
<p>again? At present I have not room to do them justice." </p>
<p>"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But </p>
<p>do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy?" </p>
<p>"They are generally long; but whether always charming it </p>
<p>is not for me to determine." </p>
<p>"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long </p>
<p>letter with ease, cannot write ill." </p>
<p>"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," </p>
<p>cried her brother, "because he does NOT write with ease. He </p>
<p>studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, </p>
<p>Darcy?" </p>
<p>"My style of writing is very different from yours." </p>
<p>"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most </p>
<p>careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and </p>
<p>blots the rest." </p>
<p>"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express </p>
<p>them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas </p>
<p>at all to my correspondents." </p>
<p>"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must </p>
<p>disarm reproof." </p>
<p>"Nothing is more deceitful," said </p>
<p>Darcy, "than the </p>
<p>appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of </p>
<p>opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast." </p>
<p>"And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece </p>
<p>of modesty?" </p>
<p>"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your </p>
<p>defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding </p>
<p>from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, </p>
<p>which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. </p>
<p>The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized </p>
<p>much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the </p>
<p>imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting </p>
<p>Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it </p>
<p>to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet </p>
<p>what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must </p>
<p>leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real </p>
<p>advantage to yourself or anyone else?" </p>
<p>"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at </p>
<p>night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And </p>
<p>yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be </p>
<p>true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did </p>
<p>not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to </p>
<p>show off before the ladies." </p>
<p>"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means </p>
<p>convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your </p>
<p>conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any </p>
<p>man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend </p>
<p>were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you </p>
<p>would probably do it, you would probably not go--and at </p>
<p>another word, might stay a month." </p>
<p>"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have </p>
<p>shown him off now much more than he did himself." </p>
<p>"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your </p>
<p>converting what my friend says into a compliment on the </p>
<p>sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a </p>
<p>turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he </p>
<p>would certainly think </p>
<p>better of me, if under such a </p>
<p>circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as </p>
<p>I could." </p>
<p>"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your </p>
<p>original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering </p>
<p>to it?" </p>
<p>"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; </p>
<p>Darcy must speak for himself." </p>
<p>"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose </p>
<p>to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing </p>
<p>the case, however, to stand according to your representation, </p>
<p>you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is </p>
<p>supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his </p>
<p>plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one </p>
<p>argument in favour of its propriety." </p>
<p>"To yield readily--easily--to the PERSUASION of a friend </p>
<p>is no merit with you." </p>
<p>"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the </p>
<p>understanding of either." </p>
<p>"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the </p>
<p>influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the </p>
<p>requester would often make one readily yield to a request, </p>
<p>without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not </p>
<p>particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed </p>
<p>about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the </p>
<p>circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his </p>
<p>behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases </p>
<p>between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the </p>
<p>other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should </p>
<p>you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, </p>
<p>without waiting to be argued into it?" </p>
<p>"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this </p>
<p>subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of </p>
<p>importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the </p>
<p>degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" </p>
<p>"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the </p>
<p>particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; </p>
<p>for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, </p>
<p>than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not </p>
<p>such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should </p>
<p>not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a </p>
<p>more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in </p>
<p>particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday </p>
<p>evening, when he has nothing to do." </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could </p>
<p>perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked </p>
<p>her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had </p>
<p>received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such </p>
<p>nonsense. </p>
<p>"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike </p>
<p>an argument, and want to silence this." </p>
<p>"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If </p>
<p>you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the </p>
<p>room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever </p>
<p>you like of me." </p>
<p>"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my </p>
<p>side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter." </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. </p>
<p>When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley </p>
<p>and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley </p>
<p>moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite </p>
<p>request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as </p>
<p>politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. </p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus </p>
<p>employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned </p>
<p>over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how </p>
<p>frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly </p>
<p>knew how to suppose that she could be an object of </p>
<p>admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at </p>
<p>her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could </p>
<p>only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice </p>
<p>because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, </p>
<p>according to his ideas of right, than in any other person </p>
<p>present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too </p>
<p>little to care for his approbation. </p>
<p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the </p>
<p>charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, </p>
<p>drawing near Elizabeth, said to her: </p>
<p>"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize </p>
<p>such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" </p>
<p>She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, </p>
<p>with some surprise at her silence. </p>
<p>"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not </p>
<p>immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I </p>
<p>know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of </p>
<p>despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those </p>
<p>kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated </p>
<p>contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that </p>
<p>I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you </p>
<p>dare." </p>
<p>"Indeed I do not dare." </p>
<p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was </p>
<p>amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness </p>
<p>and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to </p>
<p>affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by </p>
<p>any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it </p>
<p>not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some </p>
<p>danger. </p>
<p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and </p>
<p>her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane </p>
<p>received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of </p>
<p>Elizabeth. </p>
<p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, </p>
<p>by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his </p>
<p>happiness in such an alliance. </p>
<p>"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the </p>
<p>shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a </p>
<p>few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the </p>
<p>advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, </p>
<p>do sure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I </p>
<p>may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that </p>
<p>little something, </p>
<p>bordering on conceit and impertinence, </p>
<p>which your lady possesses." </p>
<p>"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic </p>
<p>felicity?" </p>
<p>"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt </p>
<p>Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next </p>
<p>to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, </p>
<p>you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's </p>
<p>picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do </p>
<p>justice to those beautiful eyes?" </p>
<p>"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but </p>
<p>their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, </p>
<p>might be copied." </p>
<p>At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. </p>
<p>Hurst and Elizabeth herself. </p>
<p>"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss </p>
<p>Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard. </p>
<p>"You used us abominably </p>
<p>ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, </p>
<p>"running away without telling us that you were coming out." </p>
<p>Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left </p>
<p>Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said: </p>
<p>"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better </p>
<p>go into the avenue." </p>
<p>But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain </p>
<p>with them, laughingly answered: </p>
<p>"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, </p>
<p>and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would </p>
<p>be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye." </p>
<p>She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in </p>
<p>the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was </p>
<p>already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a </p>
<p>couple of hours that evening. </p>

<heading>Chapter 11. </heading>
<p>When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to </p>
<p>her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her </p>
<p>into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two </p>
<p>friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had </p>
<p>never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour </p>
<p>which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of </p>
<p>conversation were considerable. They could describe an </p>
<p>entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, </p>
<p>and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. </p>
<p>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the </p>
<p>first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward </p>
<p>Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had </p>
<p>advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, </p>
<p>with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight </p>
<p>bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth </p>
<p>remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and </p>
<p>attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, </p>
<p>lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she </p>
<p>removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that </p>
<p>she might be further from the door. He then sat down by her, </p>
<p>and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the </p>
<p>opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. </p>
<p>When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law </p>
<p>of the card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private </p>
<p>intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. </p>
<p>Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured </p>
<p>him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole </p>
<p>party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had </p>
<p>therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the </p>
<p>sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did </p>
<p>the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing </p>
<p>with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her </p>
<p>brother's conversation with Miss Bennet. </p>
<p>Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in </p>
<p>watching Mr. Darcy's progress through HIS book, as in </p>
<p>reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some </p>
<p>inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, </p>
<p>however, to any conversation; he merely answered her </p>
<p>question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the </p>
<p>attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only </p>
<p>chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a </p>
<p>great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening </p>
<p>in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like </p>
<p>reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a </p>
<p>book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if </p>
<p>I have not an excellent library." </p>
<p>No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw </p>
<p>aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for </p>
<p>some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball </p>
<p>to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: </p>
<p>"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a </p>
<p>dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you deter </p>
<p>mine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am </p>
<p>much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball </p>
<p>would be rather a punishment than a pleasure." </p>
<p>"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, </p>
<p>if he chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a </p>
<p>settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup </p>
<p>enough, I shall send round my cards." </p>
<p>"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they </p>
<p>were carried on in a different manner; but there is something </p>
<p>insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It </p>
<p>would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of </p>
<p>dancing were made the order of the day." </p>
<p>"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it </p>
<p>would not be near so much like a ball." </p>
<p>Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she </p>
<p>got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, </p>
<p>and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, </p>
<p>was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, </p>
<p>she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, </p>
<p>said: </p>
<p>"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my </p>
<p>example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is </p>
<p>very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss </p>
<p>Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of </p>
<p>attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and </p>
<p>unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join </p>
<p>their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine </p>
<p>but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the </p>
<p>room together, with either of which motives his joining them </p>
<p>would interfere. "What could he mean? She was dying to </p>
<p>know what could be his meaning?"--and asked Elizabeth </p>
<p>whether she could at all understand him? </p>
<p>"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he </p>
<p>means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing </p>
<p>him will be to ask nothing about it." </p>
<p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring </p>
<p>an explanation of his two motives. </p>
<p>"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said </p>
<p>he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. "You either choose </p>
<p>this method of passing the evening because you are in each </p>
<p>other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or </p>
<p>because you are conscious that your figures appear to the </p>
<p>greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be </p>
<p>completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you </p>
<p>much better as I sit by the fire." </p>
<p>"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard </p>
<p>anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a </p>
<p>speech?" </p>
<p>"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said </p>
<p>Elizabeth. "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease </p>
<p>him- laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it </p>
<p>is to be done." </p>
<p>"But upon my honour, I do NOT. I do assure you that my </p>
<p>intimacy has not yet taught me THAT. Tease calmness of </p>
<p>manner and presence of mind! No, no--feel he may defy us </p>
<p>there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you </p>
<p>please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>may hug himself." </p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That </p>
<p>is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will </p>
<p>continue, for it would be a great loss to ME to have many </p>
<p>such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh." </p>
<p>"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me more credit than </p>
<p>can be. The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and </p>
<p>best of their actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person </p>
<p>whose first object in life is a joke." </p>
<p>"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I </p>
<p>hope I am not one of THEM. I hope I never ridicule what is </p>
<p>wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and </p>
<p>inconsistencies, DO divert me, I own, and I laugh at them </p>
<p>whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you </p>
<p>are without." </p>
<p>"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been </p>
<p>the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often </p>
<p>expose a strong understanding to ridicule." </p>
<p>"Such as vanity and pride." </p>
<p>"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there </p>
<p>is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good </p>
<p>regulation." </p>
<p>Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. </p>
<p>"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said </p>
<p>Miss Bingley; "and pray what is the result?" </p>
<p>"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no </p>
<p>defect. He owns it himself without disguise." </p>
<p>"No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have </p>
<p>faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My </p>
<p>temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding- </p>
<p>certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot </p>
<p>forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought, nor </p>
<p>their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed </p>
<p>about with every attempt to move them. My temper would </p>
<p>perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost </p>
<p>forever." </p>
<p>"THAT is a failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. "Implacable </p>
<p>resentment IS a shade in a character. But you have chosen </p>
<p>your fault well. I really cannot LAUGH at it. You are safe </p>
<p>from me." </p>
<p>"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to </p>
<p>some particular evil--a natural defect, which not even the best </p>
<p>education can overcome." </p>
<p>"And YOUR defect is to hate everybody." </p>
<p>"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to </p>
<p>misunderstand them." </p>
<p>"Do let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of </p>
<p>a conversation in which she had no share. "Louisa, you will </p>
<p>not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?" </p>
<p>Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the piano </p>
<p>forte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' </p>
<p>recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger </p>
<p>of paying Elizabeth too much attention. </p>
<heading>Chapter 12. </heading>
<p>In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, </p>
<p>Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that </p>
<p>the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. </p>
<p>But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters </p>
<p>remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which </p>
<p>would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to </p>
<p>receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was </p>
<p>not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was </p>
<p>impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they </p>
<p>could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in </p>
<p>her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister </p>
<p>pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. </p>
<p>Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively </p>
<p>resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and </p>
<p>fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding </p>
<p>themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled </p>
<p>that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning </p>
<p>should be mentioned, and the request made. </p>
<p>The communication excited many professions of concern; </p>
<p>and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the </p>
<p>following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going </p>
<p>was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had </p>
<p>proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister </p>
<p>much exceeded her affection for the other. </p>
<p>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they </p>
<p>were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss </p>
<p>Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not </p>
<p>enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to </p>
<p>be right. </p>
<p>To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had </p>
<p>been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than </p>
<p>he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to HER, and more </p>
<p>teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be </p>
<p>particularly careful that no sign of admiration should NOW </p>
<p>escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of </p>
<p>influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been </p>
<p>suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have </p>
<p>material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his </p>
<p>purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole </p>
<p>of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by </p>
<p>themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously </p>
<p>to his book, and would not even look at her. </p>
<p>On Sunday, </p>
<p>after morning service, the separation, so </p>
<p>agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to </p>
<p>Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her </p>
<p>affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the </p>
<p>latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either </p>
<p>at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most </p>
<p>tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth </p>
<p>took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits. </p>
<p>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their </p>
<p>mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought </p>
<p>them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane </p>
<p>would have caught cold again. But their father, though very </p>
<p>laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see </p>
<p>them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The </p>
<p>evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost </p>
<p>much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence </p>
<p>of Jane and Elizabeth. </p>
<p>They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough- </p>
<p>bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and </p>
<p>some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. </p>
<p>Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different </p>
<p>sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the </p>
<p>regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the </p>
<p>officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been </p>
<p>flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster </p>
<p>was going to be married. </p>

<heading>Chapter 13. </heading>
<p>"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they </p>
<p>were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a </p>
<p>good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an </p>
<p>addition to our family party." </p>
<p>"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is </p>
<p>coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to </p>
<p>call in--and I hope MY dinners are good enough for her. I do </p>
<p>not believe she often sees such at home." </p>
<p>"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a </p>
<p>stranger." </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! </p>
<p>It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be </p>
<p>extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But--good Lord! how </p>
<p>unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my </p>
<p>love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this moment." </p>
<p>"It is NOT Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person </p>
<p>whom I never saw in the whole course of my life." </p>
<p>This roused a general astonishment; and he had the </p>
<p>pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five </p>
<p>daughters at once. </p>
<p>After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he </p>
<p>thus explained: </p>
<p>"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a </p>
<p>fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some </p>
<p>delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, </p>
<p>Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of </p>
<p>this house as soon as he pleases." </p>
<p>"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that </p>
<p>mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is </p>
<p>the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be </p>
<p>entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had </p>
<p>been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or </p>
<p>other about it." </p>
<p>Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an </p>
<p>entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a </p>
<p>subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, </p>
<p>and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling </p>
<p>an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a </p>
<p>man whom nobody cared anything about. </p>
<p>"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, </p>
<p>"and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting </p>
<p>Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may </p>
<p>perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing </p>
<p>himself." </p>
<p>"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very </p>
<p>impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very </p>
<p>hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep </p>
<p>on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?" </p>
<p>"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial </p>
<p>scruples on that head, as you will hear." </p>
<p>"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October. </p>
<p>"Dear Sir,- </p>
<p>"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my </p>
<p>late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and </p>
<p>since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently </p>
<p>wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back </p>
<p>by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to </p>
<p>his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with </p>
<p>whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the </p>
<p>subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been </p>
<p>so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the </p>
<p>Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir </p>
<p>Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has </p>
<p>preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it </p>
<p>shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful </p>
<p>respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform </p>
<p>those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church </p>
<p>of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to </p>
<p>promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families </p>
<p>within in the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I </p>
<p>flatter myself that my present overtures are highly </p>
<p>commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in </p>
<p>the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on </p>
<p>your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. </p>
<p>I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of </p>
<p>injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise </p>
<p>for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them </p>
<p>every possible amends--but of this hereafter. If you should </p>
<p>have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose </p>
<p>myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, </p>
<p>Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably </p>
<p>trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday night following, </p>
<p>which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine </p>
<p>is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, </p>
<p>provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty </p>
<p>of the day.--I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to </p>
<p>your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, </p>
<p>"WILLIAM COLLINS" </p>
<p>"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace- </p>
<p>making gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the </p>
<p>letter. "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young </p>
<p>man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable </p>
<p>acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so </p>
<p>indulgent as to let him come to us again." </p>
<p>"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, </p>
<p>however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I </p>
<p>shall not be the person to discourage him." </p>
<p>"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he </p>
<p>can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the </p>
<p>wish is certainly to his credit." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference </p>
<p>for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, </p>
<p>marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were </p>
<p>required. </p>
<p>"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make </p>
<p>him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And </p>
<p>what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?- </p>
<p>We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.--Could he be </p>
<p>a sensible man, sir?" </p>
<p>"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding </p>
<p>him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self- </p>
<p>importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient </p>
<p>to see him." </p>
<p>"In point of composition," said Mary, "the letter does not </p>
<p>seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not </p>
<p>wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed." </p>
<p>To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer </p>
<p>were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that </p>
<p>their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now </p>
<p>some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society </p>
<p>of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. </p>
<p>Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she </p>
<p>was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which </p>
<p>astonished her husband and daughters. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received </p>
<p>with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed </p>
<p>said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. </p>
<p>Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor </p>
<p>inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking </p>
<p>young man of fiveand-twenty. His air was grave and stately, </p>
<p>and his manners were very formal. He had not been long </p>
<p>seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine </p>
<p>a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, </p>
<p>but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and </p>
<p>added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time </p>
<p>disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the </p>
<p>taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled </p>
<p>with no compliments, answered most readily. </p>
<p>"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart </p>
<p>it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things </p>
<p>are settled so oddly." </p>
<p>"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate." </p>
<p>"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor </p>
<p>girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with </p>
<p>YOU, for such things I know are all chance in this world. </p>
<p>There is no knowing how estates will go when once they </p>
<p>come to be entailed." </p>
<p>"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair </p>
<p>cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am </p>
<p>cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can </p>
<p>assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. </p>
<p>At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are </p>
<p>better acquainted--" </p>
<p>He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls </p>
<p>smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. </p>
<p>Collins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its </p>
<p>furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation </p>
<p>of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for </p>
<p>the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own </p>
<p>future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; </p>
<p>and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the </p>
<p>excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right </p>
<p>there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity </p>
<p>that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that </p>
<p>her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged </p>
<p>pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she </p>
<p>declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to </p>
<p>apologise for about a quarter of an hour. </p>

<heading>Chapter 14. </heading>
<p>During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when </p>
<p>the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some </p>
<p>conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in </p>
<p>which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed </p>
<p>very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's </p>
<p>attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, </p>
<p>appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen </p>
<p>better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject </p>
<p>elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and </p>
<p>with a most important aspect he protested that "he had never </p>
<p>in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such </p>
<p>affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced </p>
<p>from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to </p>
<p>approve of both of the discourses which he had already had </p>
<p>the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him </p>
<p>twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the </p>
<p>Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the </p>
<p>evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people </p>
<p>he knew, but HE had never seen anything but affability in her. </p>
<p>She had always spoken to him as she would to any other </p>
<p>gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining </p>
<p>in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the </p>
<p>parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. </p>
<p>She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as </p>
<p>he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once </p>
<p>paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had </p>
<p>perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and </p>
<p>had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself--some shelves in </p>
<p>the closet upstairs." </p>
<p>"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a </p>
<p>pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does </p>
<p>she live near you, sir?" </p>
<p>"The garden in which stands my humble abode is </p>
<p>separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's </p>
<p>residence." </p>
<p>"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any </p>
<p>family?" </p>
<p>"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of </p>
<p>very extensive property." </p>
<p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is </p>
<p>better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is </p>
<p>she? Is she handsome?" </p>
<p>"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady </p>
<p>Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de </p>
<p>Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because </p>
<p>there is that in her features which marks the young lady of </p>
<p>distinguished </p>
<p>birth. </p>
<p>She </p>
<p>is unfortunately of a sickly </p>
<p>constitution, which has prevented her from making that </p>
<p>progress in many accomplishments which she could not have </p>
<p>otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who </p>
<p>superintended her education, and who still resides with them. </p>
<p>But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive </p>
<p>by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies." </p>
<p>"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name </p>
<p>among the ladies at court." </p>
<p>"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her </p>
<p>being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine </p>
<p>one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest </p>
<p>ornaments. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and </p>
<p>you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer </p>
<p>those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable </p>
<p>to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, </p>
<p>that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and </p>
<p>that the most elevated rank, instead of giving </p>
<p>her </p>
<p>consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of </p>
<p>little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of </p>
<p>attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay." </p>
<p>"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is </p>
<p>happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with </p>
<p>delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed </p>
<p>from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous </p>
<p>study?" </p>
<p>"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and </p>
<p>though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and </p>
<p>arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted </p>
<p>to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied </p>
<p>an air as possible." </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin </p>
<p>was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the </p>
<p>keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most </p>
<p>resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an </p>
<p>occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his </p>
<p>pleasure. </p>
<p>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. </p>
<p>Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room </p>
<p>again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read </p>
<p>aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book </p>
<p>was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced </p>
<p>it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and </p>
<p>begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty </p>
<p>stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were </p>
<p>produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's </p>
<p>Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he </p>
<p>had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she </p>
<p>interrupted him with: </p>
<p>"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of </p>
<p>turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will </p>
<p>hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk </p>
<p>to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when </p>
<p>Mr. Denny comes back from town." </p>
<p>Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; </p>
<p>but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said: </p>
<p>"I have often observed how little young ladies are </p>
<p>interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely </p>
<p>for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there </p>
<p>can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I </p>
<p>will no longer importune my young cousin." </p>
<p>Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his </p>
<p>antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the </p>
<p>challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the </p>
<p>girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her </p>
<p>daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and </p>
<p>promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume </p>
<p>his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his </p>
<p>young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her </p>
<p>behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon. </p>
<heading>Chapter 15. </heading>
<p>Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of </p>
<p>nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the </p>
<p>greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance </p>
<p>of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to </p>
<p>one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary </p>
<p>terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The </p>
<p>subjection in which his father had brought him up had given </p>
<p>him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a </p>
<p>good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, </p>
<p>living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early </p>
<p>and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had </p>
<p>recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the </p>
<p>living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt </p>
<p>for her high rank, </p>
<p>and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a </p>
<p>very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, </p>
<p>and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of </p>
<p>pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility. </p>
<p>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he </p>
<p>intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the </p>
<p>Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to </p>
<p>choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome </p>
<p>and amiable as they were represented by common report. This </p>
<p>was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their </p>
<p>father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of </p>
<p>eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and </p>
<p>disinterested on his own part. </p>
<p>His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely </p>
<p>face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest </p>
<p>notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening </p>
<p>SHE was his settled choice. The next morning, however, </p>
<p>made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete </p>
<p>with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning </p>
<p>with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal </p>
<p>of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at </p>
<p>Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles </p>
<p>and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he </p>
<p>had fixed on. "As to her YOUNGER daughters, she could not </p>
<p>take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she </p>
<p>did not KNOW of any prepossession; her ELDEST daughter, </p>
<p>she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, </p>
<p>was likely to be very soon engaged." </p>
<p>Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth-and </p>
<p>it was soon done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the </p>
<p>fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, </p>
<p>succeeded her of course. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she </p>
<p>might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom </p>
<p>she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in </p>
<p>her good graces. </p>
<p>Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; </p>
<p>every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. </p>
<p>Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who </p>
<p>was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to </p>
<p>himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after </p>
<p>breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged </p>
<p>with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really </p>
<p>talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and </p>
<p>garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet </p>
<p>exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure </p>
<p>and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to </p>
<p>meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, </p>
<p>he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, </p>
<p>was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters </p>
<p>in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted </p>
<p>for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his </p>
<p>large book, and go. </p>
<p>In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that </p>
<p>of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The </p>
<p>attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained </p>
<p>by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the </p>
<p>street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very </p>
<p>smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop </p>
<p>window, could recall them. </p>
<p>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young </p>
<p>man, whom they </p>
<p>had never seen before, of most </p>
<p>gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the </p>
<p>other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny </p>
<p>concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, </p>
<p>and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the </p>
<p>stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and </p>
<p>Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across </p>
<p>the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite </p>
<p>shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the </p>
<p>two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. </p>
<p>Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to </p>
<p>introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with </p>
<p>him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had </p>
<p>accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it </p>
<p>should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to </p>
<p>make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly </p>
<p>in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine </p>
<p>countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The </p>
<p>introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness </p>
<p>of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct </p>
<p>and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and </p>
<p>talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses </p>
<p>drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding </p>
<p>down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the </p>
<p>two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the </p>
<p>usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and </p>
<p>Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his </p>
<p>way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine </p>
<p>not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly </p>
<p>arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening </p>
<p>to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, </p>
<p>was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both </p>
<p>changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. </p>
<p>Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation </p>
<p>which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the </p>
<p>meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible </p>
<p>not to long to know. </p>
<p>In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to </p>
<p>have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his </p>
<p>friend. </p>
<p>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young </p>
<p>ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their </p>
<p>bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they </p>
<p>should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing </p>
<p>up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation. </p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the </p>
<p>two eldest, from their recent absence, were </p>
<p>particularly </p>
<p>welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their </p>
<p>sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not </p>
<p>fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she </p>
<p>had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street, </p>
<p>who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts </p>
<p>to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, </p>
<p>when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's </p>
<p>introduction of him. She received him with her very best </p>
<p>politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising </p>
<p>for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, </p>
<p>which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be </p>
<p>justified by his relationship to the young ladies who </p>
<p>introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by </p>
<p>such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one </p>
<p>stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries </p>
<p>about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her </p>
<p>nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought </p>
<p>him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's </p>
<p>commission in the ---shire. She had been watching him the </p>
<p>last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and </p>
<p>had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly </p>
<p>have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed </p>
<p>windows now except a few of the officers, who, in </p>
<p>comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, </p>
<p>disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the </p>
<p>Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her </p>
<p>husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation </p>
<p>also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the </p>
<p>evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that </p>
<p>they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery </p>
<p>tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect </p>
<p>of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual </p>
<p>good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the </p>
<p>room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they </p>
<p>were perfectly needless. </p>
<p>As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she </p>
<p>had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane </p>
<p>would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be </p>
<p>in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than </p>
<p>her sister. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by </p>
<p>admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested </p>
<p>that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never </p>
<p>seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received </p>
<p>him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him </p>
<p>in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly </p>
<p>unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be </p>
<p>attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never </p>
<p>met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. </p>

<heading>Chapter 16. </heading>
<p>As no objection was made to the young people's </p>
<p>engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of </p>
<p>leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his </p>
<p>visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and </p>
<p>his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls </p>
<p>had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, </p>
<p>that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and </p>
<p>was then in the house. </p>
<p>When this information was given, and they had all taken </p>
<p>their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and </p>
<p>admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture </p>
<p>of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have </p>
<p>supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at </p>
<p>Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much </p>
<p>gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him </p>
<p>what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had </p>
<p>listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's </p>
<p>drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had </p>
<p>cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the </p>
<p>compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison </p>
<p>with the housekeeper's room. </p>
<p>In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and </p>
<p>her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own </p>
<p>humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was </p>
<p>happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he </p>
<p>found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion </p>
<p>of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who </p>
<p>was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as </p>
<p>she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, </p>
<p>and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and </p>
<p>examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the </p>
<p>mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was </p>
<p>over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she </p>
<p>had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, </p>
<p>with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The </p>
<p>officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, </p>
<p>gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present </p>
<p>party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, </p>
<p>countenance, air, and walk, as THEY were superior to the </p>
<p>broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who </p>
<p>followed them into the room. </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost </p>
<p>every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy </p>
<p>woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable </p>
<p>manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, </p>
<p>though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that </p>
<p>the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be </p>
<p>rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. </p>
<p>With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham </p>
<p>and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into </p>
<p>insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; </p>
<p>but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and </p>
<p>was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with </p>
<p>coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had </p>
<p>the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to </p>
<p>whist. </p>
<p>"I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall </p>
<p>be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--" Mrs. </p>
<p>Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait </p>
<p>for his reason. </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight </p>
<p>was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and </p>
<p>Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him </p>
<p>entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being </p>
<p>likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too </p>
<p>much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and </p>
<p>exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in </p>
<p>particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and </p>
<p>she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly </p>
<p>wished to hear she could not hope to be told--the history of </p>
<p>his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention </p>
<p>that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly </p>
<p>relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired </p>
<p>how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving </p>
<p>her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>had been staying there. </p>
<p>"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let </p>
<p>the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in </p>
<p>Derbyshire, I understand." </p>
<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate there is a noble </p>
<p>one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met </p>
<p>with a person more capable of giving you certain information </p>
<p>on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his </p>
<p>family in a particular manner from my infancy." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not but look surprised. </p>
<p>"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an </p>
<p>assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold </p>
<p>manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted </p>
<p>with Mr. Darcy?" </p>
<p>"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very </p>
<p>warmly. "I have spent four days in the same house with him, </p>
<p>and I think him very disagreeable." </p>
<p>"I have no right to give MY opinion," said Wickham, "as </p>
<p>to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form </p>
<p>one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair </p>
<p>judge. It is impossible for ME to be impartial. But I believe </p>
<p>your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps </p>
<p>you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. </p>
<p>Here you are in your own family." </p>
<p>"Upon my word, I say no more HERE than I might say in </p>
<p>any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not </p>
<p>at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his </p>
<p>pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by </p>
<p>anyone." </p>
<p>"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short </p>
<p>interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated </p>
<p>beyond their deserts; but with HIM I believe it does not often </p>
<p>happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, </p>
<p>or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him </p>
<p>only as he chooses to be seen." </p>
<p>"I should take him, even on MY slight acquaintance, to be </p>
<p>an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head. </p>
<p>"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, </p>
<p>"whether he is likely to be in this country much longer." </p>
<p>"I do not at all know; but I HEARD nothing of his going </p>
<p>away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour </p>
<p>of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the </p>
<p>neighbourhood." </p>
<p>"Oh! no--it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. </p>
<p>If HE wishes to avoid seeing ME, he must go. We are not on </p>
<p>friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I </p>
<p>have no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim </p>
<p>before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most </p>
<p>painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss </p>
<p>Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever </p>
<p>breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be </p>
<p>in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the </p>
<p>soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to </p>
<p>myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could </p>
<p>forgive him anything and everything, rather than his </p>
<p>disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his </p>
<p>father." </p>
<p>Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and </p>
<p>listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented </p>
<p>further inquiry. </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, </p>
<p>Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly </p>
<p>pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter </p>
<p>with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. </p>
<p>"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," </p>
<p>he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the --- </p>
<p>shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and </p>
<p>my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their </p>
<p>present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent </p>
<p>acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is </p>
<p>necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my </p>
<p>spirits will not bear solitude. I MUST have employment and </p>
<p>society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but </p>
<p>circumstances have now made it eligible. The church OUGHT </p>
<p>to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, </p>
<p>and I should at this time have been in possession of a most </p>
<p>valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were </p>
<p>speaking of just now." </p>
<p>"Indeed!" </p>
<p>"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>bequeathed me the next </p>
<p>presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my </p>
<p>godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice </p>
<p>to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and </p>
<p>thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given </p>
<p>elsewhere." </p>
<p>"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could THAT </p>
<p>be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek </p>
<p>legal redress?" </p>
<p>"There was just such an informality in the terms of the </p>
<p>bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour </p>
<p>could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to </p>
<p>doubt </p>
<p>it--or </p>
<p>to treat it as a merely conditional </p>
<p>recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to </p>
<p>it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. </p>
<p>Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, </p>
<p>exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to </p>
<p>another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse </p>
<p>myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I </p>
<p>have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my </p>
<p>opinion OF him, and TO him, too freely. I can recall nothing </p>
<p>worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, </p>
<p>and that he hates me." </p>
<p>"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly </p>
<p>disgraced." </p>
<p>"Some time or other he WILL be--but it shall not be by </p>
<p>ME. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose </p>
<p>HIM." </p>
<p>Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him </p>
<p>handsomer than ever as he expressed them. </p>
<p>"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his </p>
<p>motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?" </p>
<p>"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I </p>
<p>cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me </p>
<p>better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated </p>
<p>him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear </p>
<p>the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of </p>
<p>preference which was often given me." </p>
<p>"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have </p>
<p>never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had </p>
<p>supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, </p>
<p>but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious </p>
<p>revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this." </p>
<p>After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I </p>
<p>DO remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the </p>
<p>implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving </p>
<p>temper. His disposition must be dreadful." </p>
<p>"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; </p>
<p>"I can hardly be just to him." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time </p>
<p>exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, </p>
<p>the favourite of his father!" She could have added, "A young </p>
<p>man, too, like YOU, whose very countenance may vouch for </p>
<p>your being amiable"--but she contented herself with, "and </p>
<p>one, too, who had probably been his companion from </p>
<p>childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the </p>
<p>closest manner!" </p>
<p>"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; </p>
<p>the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of </p>
<p>the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the </p>
<p>same parental care. MY father began life in the profession </p>
<p>which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit </p>
<p>to--but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley </p>
<p>property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most </p>
<p>intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged </p>
<p>himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's </p>
<p>active superintendence, and when, immediately before my </p>
<p>father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of </p>
<p>providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much </p>
<p>a debt of gratitude to HIM, as of his affection to myself." </p>
<p>"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I </p>
<p>wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made </p>
<p>him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not </p>
<p>have been too proud to be dishonest--for dishonesty I must </p>
<p>call it." </p>
<p>"It IS wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all his </p>
<p>actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his </p>
<p>best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with </p>
<p>any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his </p>
<p>behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than </p>
<p>pride." </p>
<p>"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him </p>
<p>good?" </p>
<p>"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to </p>
<p>give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his </p>
<p>tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and FILIAL pride- </p>
<p>-for he is very proud of what his father was--have done this. </p>
<p>Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the </p>
<p>popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley </p>
<p>House, is a powerful motive. He has also BROTHERLY </p>
<p>pride, which, with SOME brotherly affection, makes him a </p>
<p>very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear </p>
<p>him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of </p>
<p>brothers." </p>
<p>"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?" </p>
<p>He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It </p>
<p>gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like </p>
<p>her brother--very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate </p>
<p>and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted </p>
<p>hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me </p>
<p>now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I </p>
<p>understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her </p>
<p>home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and </p>
<p>superintends her education." </p>
<p>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and </p>
<p>saying: </p>
<p>"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How </p>
<p>can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I </p>
<p>really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a </p>
<p>man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley?" </p>
<p>"Not at all." </p>
<p>"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He </p>
<p>cannot know what Mr. Darcy is." </p>
<p>"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. </p>
<p>He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible </p>
<p>companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who </p>
<p>are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man </p>
<p>from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts </p>
<p>him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, </p>
<p>rational, honourable, and perhaps </p>
<p>agreeable--allowing </p>
<p>something for fortune and figure." </p>
<p>The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players </p>
<p>gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station </p>
<p>between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual </p>
<p>inquiries as to his success was made by the latter. It had not </p>
<p>been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. </p>
<p>Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured </p>
<p>her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least </p>
<p>importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and </p>
<p>begged that she would not make herself uneasy. </p>
<p>"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit </p>
<p>down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these </p>
<p>things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make </p>
<p>five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who </p>
<p>could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de </p>
<p>Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding </p>
<p>little matters." </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing </p>
<p>Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low </p>
<p>voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted </p>
<p>with the family of de Bourgh. </p>
<p>"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately </p>
<p>given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first </p>
<p>introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her </p>
<p>long." </p>
<p>"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and </p>
<p>Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt </p>
<p>to the present Mr. Darcy." </p>
<p>"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady </p>
<p>Catherine's connections. I never heard of her existence till the </p>
<p>day before yesterday." </p>
<p>"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large </p>
<p>fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite </p>
<p>the two estates." </p>
<p>This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of </p>
<p>poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, </p>
<p>vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of </p>
<p>himself, if he were already self-destined for another. </p>
<p>"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady </p>
<p>Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he </p>
<p>has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads </p>
<p>him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an </p>
<p>arrogant, conceited woman." </p>
<p>"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied </p>
<p>Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well </p>
<p>remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were </p>
<p>dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being </p>
<p>remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she </p>
<p>derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part </p>
<p>from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for </p>
<p>her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him </p>
<p>should have an understanding of the first class." </p>
<p>Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account </p>
<p>of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual </p>
<p>satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of </p>
<p>the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There </p>
<p>could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper </p>
<p>party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. </p>
<p>Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done </p>
<p>gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. </p>
<p>She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what </p>
<p>he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for </p>
<p>her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia </p>
<p>nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of </p>
<p>lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had </p>
<p>won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and </p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his </p>
<p>losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and </p>
<p>repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to </p>
<p>say than he could well man age before the carriage stopped at </p>
<p>Longbourn House. </p>

<p>Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed </p>
<p>between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with </p>
<p>astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and </p>
<p>yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young </p>
<p>man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility </p>
<p>of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest </p>
<p>all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be </p>
<p>done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of </p>
<p>each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake </p>
<p>whatever could not be otherwise explained. </p>
<p>"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in </p>
<p>some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested </p>
<p>people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in </p>
<p>short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or </p>
<p>circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual </p>
<p>blame on either side." </p>
<p>"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you </p>
<p>got to say on behalf of the interested people who have </p>
<p>probably been concerned in the business? Do clear THEM </p>
<p>too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody." </p>
<p>"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me </p>
<p>out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what </p>
<p>a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his </p>
<p>father's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had </p>
<p>promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common </p>
<p>humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could </p>
<p>be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so </p>
<p>excessively deceived in him? Oh! no." </p>
<p>"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being </p>
<p>imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a </p>
<p>history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, </p>
<p>everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks." </p>
<p>"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know </p>
<p>what to think." </p>
<p>"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think." </p>
<p>But Jane could think with certainty on only one point-that </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley, if he HAD been imposed on, would have much </p>
<p>to suffer when the affair became public. </p>
<p>The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, </p>
<p>where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very </p>
<p>persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his </p>
<p>sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long- </p>
<p>expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the </p>
<p>following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their </p>
<p>dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and </p>
<p>repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since </p>
<p>their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little </p>
<p>attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying </p>
<p>not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They </p>
<p>were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity </p>
<p>which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if </p>
<p>eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities. </p>
<p>The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely </p>
<p>agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to </p>
<p>consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and </p>
<p>was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured </p>
<p>to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, </p>
<p>and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth thought with </p>
<p>pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of </p>
<p>seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and </p>
<p>behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia </p>
<p>depended less on any single event, or any particular person, </p>
<p>for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the </p>
<p>evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only </p>
<p>partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a </p>
<p>ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no </p>
<p>disinclination for it. </p>
<p>"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is </p>
<p>enough--I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in </p>
<p>evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I </p>
<p>profess myself one of those who consider intervals of </p>
<p>recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody." </p>
<p>Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that </p>
<p>though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, </p>
<p>she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think </p>
<p>it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was </p>
<p>rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple </p>
<p>whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a </p>
<p>rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de </p>
<p>Bourgh, by venturing to dance. </p>
<p>"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, </p>
<p>"that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to </p>
<p>respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so </p>
<p>far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be </p>
<p>honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of </p>
<p>the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, </p>
<p>Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a </p>
<p>preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the </p>
<p>right cause, and not to any disrespect for her." </p>
<p>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully </p>
<p>proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very </p>
<p>dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had </p>
<p>never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed </p>
<p>a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as </p>
<p>good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with </p>
<p>his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It </p>
<p>now first struck her, that SHE was selected from among her </p>
<p>sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, </p>
<p>and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the </p>
<p>absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to </p>
<p>conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward </p>
<p>herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her </p>
<p>wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified </p>
<p>herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her </p>
<p>mother gave her to understand that the probability of their </p>
<p>marriage was extremely agreeable to HER. Elizabeth, </p>
<p>however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware </p>
<p>that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was </p>
<p>useless to quarrel about him. </p>
<p>If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and </p>
<p>talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very </p>
<p>pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to </p>
<p>the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as </p>
<p>prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no </p>
<p>officers, no news could be sought after--the very shoe-roses </p>
<p>for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have </p>
<p>found some trial of her patience in weather which totally </p>
<p>suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. </p>
<p>Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could </p>
<p>have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday </p>
<p>endurable to Kitty and Lydia. </p>
<header>Ebd </header>

<heading>Chapter 18. </heading>
<p>Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, </p>
<p>and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red </p>
<p>coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never </p>
<p>occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been </p>
<p>checked by any of those recollections that might not </p>
<p>unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more </p>
<p>than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the </p>
<p>conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting </p>
<p>that it was not more than might be won in the course of the </p>
<p>evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his </p>
<p>being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the </p>
<p>Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not </p>
<p>exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was </p>
<p>pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly </p>
<p>applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to </p>
<p>go to town on business the day before, and was not yet </p>
<p>returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine </p>
<p>his business would have called him away just now, if he had </p>
<p>not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here." </p>
<p>This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was </p>
<p>caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not </p>
<p>less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first </p>
<p>surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the </p>
<p>former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that </p>
<p>she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite in </p>
<p>quiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. </p>
<p>Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to </p>
<p>Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation </p>
<p>with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which </p>
<p>she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. </p>
<p>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though </p>
<p>every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it </p>
<p>could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her </p>
<p>griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, </p>
<p>she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the </p>
<p>oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular </p>
<p>notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of </p>
<p>distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, </p>
<p>awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and </p>
<p>often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all </p>
<p>the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a </p>
<p>couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from </p>
<p>him was ecstasy. </p>
<p>She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment </p>
<p>of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally </p>
<p>liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte </p>
<p>Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found </p>
<p>herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so </p>
<p>much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without </p>
<p>knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away </p>
<p>again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want </p>
<p>of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her: </p>
<p>"I dare say you will find him very agreeable." </p>
<p>"Heaven forbid! THAT would be the greatest misfortune </p>
<p>of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to </p>
<p>hate! Do not wish me such an evil." </p>
<p>When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy </p>
<p>approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help </p>
<p>cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow </p>
<p>her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the </p>
<p>eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no </p>
<p>answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to </p>
<p>which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal </p>
<p>amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without </p>
<p>speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence </p>
<p>was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved </p>
<p>not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the </p>
<p>greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she </p>
<p>made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and </p>
<p>was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she </p>
<p>addressed him a second time with:--"It is YOUR turn to say </p>
<p>something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and </p>
<p>YOU ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the </p>
<p>room, or the number of couples." </p>
<p>He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him </p>
<p>to say should be said. </p>
<p>"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by </p>
<p>and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter </p>
<p>than public ones. But NOW we may be silent." </p>
<p>"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?" </p>
<p>"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would </p>
<p>look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet </p>
<p>for the advantage of SOME, conversation ought to be so </p>
<p>arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little </p>
<p>as possible." </p>
<p>"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, </p>
<p>or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?" </p>
<p>"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a </p>
<p>great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an </p>
<p>unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we </p>
<p>expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and </p>
<p>be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb." </p>
<p>"This is no very striking resemblance of your own </p>
<p>character, I am sure," said he. "How near it may be to MINE, </p>
<p>I cannot pretend to say. YOU think it a faithful portrait </p>
<p>undoubtedly." </p>
<p>"I must not decide on my own performance." </p>
<p>He made no answer, and they were again silent till they </p>
<p>had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her </p>
<p>sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in </p>
<p>the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, </p>
<p>"When you met us there the other day, we had just been </p>
<p>forming a new acquaintance." </p>
<p>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur </p>
<p>overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, </p>
<p>though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go </p>
<p>on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, </p>
<p>"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may </p>
<p>ensure his MAKING friends--whether he may be equally </p>
<p>capable of RETAINING them, is less certain." </p>
<p>"He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship," </p>
<p>replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is </p>
<p>likely to suffer from all his life." </p>
<p>Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing </p>
<p>the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared </p>
<p>close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other </p>
<p>side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped </p>
<p>with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his </p>
<p>dancing and his partner. </p>
<p>"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. </p>
<p>Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that </p>
<p>you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that </p>
<p>your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope </p>
<p>to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain </p>
<p>desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and </p>
<p>Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow </p>
<p>in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. </p>
<p>You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching </p>
<p>converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also up </p>
<p>braiding me." </p>
<p>The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; </p>
<p>but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him </p>
<p>forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious </p>
<p>expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing </p>
<p>together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to </p>
<p>his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has made me </p>
<p>forget what we were talking of." </p>
<p>"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could </p>
<p>not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to </p>
<p>say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects </p>
<p>already without success, and what we are to talk of next I </p>
<p>cannot imagine." </p>
<p>"What think you of books?" said he, smiling. </p>
<p>"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not </p>
<p>with the same feelings." </p>
<p>"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can </p>
<p>at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different </p>
<p>opinions." </p>
<p>"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is </p>
<p>always full of something else." </p>
<p>"The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes--does </p>
<p>it?" said he, with a look of doubt. </p>
<p>"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, </p>
<p>for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon </p>
<p>afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember </p>
<p>hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever </p>
<p>forgave, that you resentment once created was unappeasable. </p>
<p>You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its BEING </p>
<p>CREATED." </p>
<p>"I am," said he, with a firm voice. </p>
<p>"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?" </p>
<p>"I hope not." </p>
<p>"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change </p>
<p>their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first." </p>
<p>"May I ask to what these questions tend?" </p>
<p>"Merely to the illustration of YOUR character," said she, </p>
<p>endeavouring to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it </p>
<p>out." </p>
<p>"And what is your success?" </p>
<p>She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such </p>
<p>different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly." </p>
<p>"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports </p>
<p>may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss </p>
<p>Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the </p>
<p>present moment, as there is reason to fear that the </p>
<p>performance would reflect no credit on either." </p>
<p>"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have </p>
<p>another opportunity." </p>
<p>"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he </p>
<p>coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the </p>
<p>other dance and parted in silence; and on each side </p>
<p>dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's </p>
<p>breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, </p>
<p>which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger </p>
<p>against another. </p>
<p>They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came </p>
<p>towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted </p>
<p>her: </p>
<p>"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George </p>
<p>Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and </p>
<p>asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man </p>
<p>quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that </p>
<p>he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward. </p>
<p>Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give </p>
<p>implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's </p>
<p>using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has </p>
<p>always been remarkably kind </p>
<p>to </p>
<p>him, though </p>
<p>George </p>
<p>Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I </p>
<p>do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear </p>
<p>George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother </p>
<p>thought that he could not well avoid including him in his </p>
<p>invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that </p>
<p>he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the </p>
<p>country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder </p>
<p>how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this </p>
<p>discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his </p>
<p>descent, one could not expect much better." </p>
<p>"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the </p>
<p>same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse </p>
<p>him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's </p>
<p>steward, and of THAT, I can assure you, he informed me </p>
<p>himself." </p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away </p>
<p>with a sneer. "Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant." </p>
<p>"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much </p>
<p>mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack </p>
<p>as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and </p>
<p>the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, </p>
<p>who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of </p>
<p>Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet </p>
<p>complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently </p>
<p>marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the </p>
<p>evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that </p>
<p>moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his </p>
<p>enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of </p>
<p>Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness. </p>
<p>"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less </p>
<p>smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. </p>
<p>Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged </p>
<p>to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of </p>
<p>my pardon." </p>
<p>"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have </p>
<p>nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know </p>
<p>the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circum </p>
<p>stances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he </p>
<p>will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of </p>
<p>his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has </p>
<p>deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has </p>
<p>received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his </p>
<p>sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young </p>
<p>man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has </p>
<p>deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard." </p>
<p>"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?" </p>
<p>"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton." </p>
<p>"This account then is what he has received from Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?" </p>
<p>"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though </p>
<p>he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he </p>
<p>believes that it was left to him CONDITIONALLY only." </p>
<p>"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's </p>
<p>sincerity," said </p>
<p>Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being </p>
<p>convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his </p>
<p>friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is </p>
<p>unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the </p>
<p>rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of </p>
<p>both gentlemen as I did before." </p>
<p>She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to </p>
<p>each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. </p>
<p>Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest </p>
<p>hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and </p>
<p>said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their </p>
<p>being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to </p>
<p>Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last </p>
<p>partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up </p>
<p>to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just </p>
<p>been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. </p>
<p>"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that </p>
<p>there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I </p>
<p>happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the </p>
<p>young lady who does the honours of the house the names of </p>
<p>his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. </p>
<p>How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have </p>
<p>thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady </p>
<p>Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that </p>
<p>the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to </p>
<p>him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my </p>
<p>not having done it before. My total ignorance of the </p>
<p>connection must plead my apology." </p>
<p>"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!" </p>
<p>"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done </p>
<p>it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's NEPHEW. It </p>
<p>will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite </p>
<p>well yesterday se'nnight." </p>
<p>Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, </p>
<p>assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing </p>
<p>him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather </p>
<p>than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least </p>
<p>necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if </p>
<p>it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in </p>
<p>consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened </p>
<p>to her with the determined air of following his own </p>
<p>inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus: </p>
<p>"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the </p>
<p>world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the </p>
<p>scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there </p>
<p>must be a wide difference between the established forms of </p>
<p>ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the </p>
<p>clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the </p>
<p>clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest </p>
<p>rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of </p>
<p>behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore </p>
<p>allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this </p>
<p>occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point </p>
<p>of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, </p>
<p>which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, </p>
<p>though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by </p>
<p>education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a </p>
<p>young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to </p>
<p>attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly </p>
<p>watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was </p>
<p>very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn </p>
<p>bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if </p>
<p>hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words </p>
<p>"apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It </p>
<p>vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last </p>
<p>Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of </p>
<p>distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged </p>
<p>from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed </p>
<p>abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, </p>
<p>and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved </p>
<p>another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth. </p>
<p>"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied </p>
<p>with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the </p>
<p>attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even </p>
<p>paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well </p>
<p>convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain </p>
<p>she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a </p>
<p>very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased </p>
<p>with him." </p>
<p>As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to </p>
<p>pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister </p>
<p>and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which </p>
<p>her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as </p>
<p>happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, </p>
<p>in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could </p>
<p>bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of </p>
<p>endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's </p>
<p>thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she </p>
<p>determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too </p>
<p>much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she </p>
<p>considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them </p>
<p>within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find </p>
<p>that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) </p>
<p>freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that </p>
<p>Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an </p>
<p>animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of </p>
<p>fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His </p>
<p>being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but </p>
<p>three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; </p>
<p>and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two </p>
<p>sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the </p>
<p>connection as much as she could do. It </p>
<p>was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger </p>
<p>daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in </p>
<p>the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her </p>
<p>time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the </p>
<p>care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into </p>
<p>company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this </p>
<p>circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions </p>
<p>it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She </p>
<p>concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might </p>
<p>soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly </p>
<p>believing there was no chance of it. </p>
<p>In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of </p>
<p>her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in </p>
<p>a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she </p>
<p>could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her </p>
<p>for being nonsensical. </p>
<p>"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of </p>
<p>him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be </p>
<p>obliged to say nothing HE may not like to hear." </p>
<p>"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage </p>
<p>can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never </p>
<p>recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!" </p>
<p>Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. </p>
<p>Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible </p>
<p>tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and </p>
<p>vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she </p>
<p>dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, </p>
<p>she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by </p>
<p>her. The expression of his face changed gradually from </p>
<p>indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity. </p>
<p>At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and </p>
<p>Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of </p>
<p>delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to </p>
<p>the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to </p>
<p>revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when </p>
<p>supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the </p>
<p>mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, </p>
<p>preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks </p>
<p>and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a </p>
<p>proof of complaisance, but in </p>
<p>vain; Mary would not </p>
<p>understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was </p>
<p>delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes </p>
<p>were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she </p>
<p>watched her progress through the several stanzas with an </p>
<p>impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for </p>
<p>Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint </p>
<p>of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, </p>
<p>after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers </p>
<p>were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was </p>
<p>weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She </p>
<p>looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very </p>
<p>composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, </p>
<p>and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at </p>
<p>Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She </p>
<p>looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary </p>
<p>should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary </p>
<p>had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do </p>
<p>extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let </p>
<p>the other young ladies have time to exhibit." </p>
<p>Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat </p>
<p>disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her </p>
<p>father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. </p>
<p>Others of the party were now applied to. </p>
<p>"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to </p>
<p>sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the </p>
<p>company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent </p>
<p>diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a </p>
<p>clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be </p>
<p>justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there </p>
<p>are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a </p>
<p>parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such </p>
<p>an agreement for tithes as a may be beneficial to himself and </p>
<p>not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; </p>
<p>and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish </p>
<p>duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which </p>
<p>he cannot be excused from making as a comfortable as </p>
<p>possible. </p>
<p>And I do not think it of light importance that he should have </p>
<p>attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody, </p>
<p>especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I </p>
<p>cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the </p>
<p>man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect </p>
<p>towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow </p>
<p>to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been </p>
<p>spoken so loud as a to be heard by half the room. Many </p>
<p>stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. </p>
<p>Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half- </p>
<p>whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good </p>
<p>kind of young man. </p>
<p>To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an </p>
<p>agreement to expose themselves as a much as a they could </p>
<p>during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to </p>
<p>play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy </p>
<p>did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the </p>
<p>exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were </p>
<p>not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must </p>
<p>have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, </p>
<p>should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, </p>
<p>was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the </p>
<p>silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the </p>
<p>ladies, were more intolerable. </p>
<p>The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She </p>
<p>was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly </p>
<p>by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance </p>
<p>with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. </p>
<p>In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, </p>
<p>and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He </p>
<p>assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to </p>
<p>it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to </p>
<p>recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a </p>
<p>point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was </p>
<p>no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to </p>
<p>her friend </p>
<p>Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and </p>
<p>goodnaturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself. </p>
<p>She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's </p>
<p>further notice; though often standing within a very short </p>
<p>distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough </p>
<p>to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her </p>
<p>allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it. </p>
<p>The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to </p>
<p>depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for </p>
<p>their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was </p>
<p>gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were </p>
<p>wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister </p>
<p>scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, </p>
<p>and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. </p>
<p>They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, </p>
<p>and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which </p>
<p>was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, </p>
<p>who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the </p>
<p>elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and </p>
<p>politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. </p>
<p>Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was </p>
<p>enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing </p>
<p>together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to </p>
<p>each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either </p>
<p>Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much </p>
<p>fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of </p>
<p>"Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn. </p>
<p>When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was </p>
<p>most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family </p>
<p>soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by </p>
<p>eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the </p>
<p>ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful </p>
<p>pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest </p>
<p>opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, </p>
<p>whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house </p>
<p>under the </p>
<p>delightful </p>
<p>persuasion that, allowing </p>
<p>for the </p>
<p>necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and </p>
<p>wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter </p>
<p>settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of </p>
<p>having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought </p>
<p>with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, </p>
<p>pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her </p>
<p>children; and though the man and the match were quite good </p>
<p>enough for HER, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley and Netherfield. </p>
<heading>Chapter 19. </heading>
<p>The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. </p>
<p>Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it </p>
<p>without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to </p>
<p>the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence </p>
<p>to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set </p>
<p>about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, </p>
<p>which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, </p>
<p>soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: </p>
<p>"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair </p>
<p>daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private </p>
<p>audience with her in the course of this morning?" </p>
<p>Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of </p>
<p>surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!--yes-- </p>
<p>certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she </p>
<p>can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs." </p>
<p>And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, </p>
<p>when Elizabeth called out: </p>
<p>"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. </p>
<p>Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me </p>
<p>that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself." </p>
<p>"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you </p>
<p>are." And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and </p>
<p>embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: "Lizzy, I </p>
<p>INSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins." </p>
<p>Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a </p>
<p>moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would </p>
<p>be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she </p>
<p>sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment </p>
<p>the feelings which were </p>
<p>divided between distress and </p>
<p>diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as </p>
<p>they were gone, Mr. Collins began. </p>
<p>"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, </p>
<p>so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other </p>
<p>perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes </p>
<p>had there NOT been this little unwillingness; but allow me to </p>
<p>assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for </p>
<p>this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my </p>
<p>discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to </p>
<p>dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be </p>
<p>mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you </p>
<p>out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run </p>
<p>away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be </p>
<p>advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and, </p>
<p>moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of </p>
<p>selecting a wife, as I certainly did." </p>
<p>The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, </p>
<p>being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near </p>
<p>laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in </p>
<p>any attempt to stop him further, and he continued: </p>
<p>"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right </p>
<p>thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself ) </p>
<p>to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I </p>
<p>am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; </p>
<p>and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, </p>
<p>that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very </p>
<p>noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. </p>
<p>Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked </p>
<p>too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night </p>
<p>before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while </p>
<p>Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that </p>
<p>she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you </p>
<p>must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for MY </p>
<p>sake; and for your OWN, let her be an active, useful sort of </p>
<p>person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income </p>
<p>go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon </p>
<p>as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow </p>
<p>me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not </p>
<p>reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh </p>
<p>as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. </p>
<p>You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; </p>
<p>and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, </p>
<p>especially when tempered with the silence and respect which </p>
<p>her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general </p>
<p>intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why </p>
<p>my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my </p>
<p>own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many </p>
<p>amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to </p>
<p>inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father </p>
<p>(who, however, may live many years longer), I could not </p>
<p>satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among </p>
<p>his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as </p>
<p>possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, </p>
<p>however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. </p>
<p>This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself </p>
<p>it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains </p>
<p>but for me but to assure you in the most animated language of </p>
<p>the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly </p>
<p>indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your </p>
<p>father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied </p>
<p>with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, </p>
<p>which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all </p>
<p>that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I </p>
<p>shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no </p>
<p>ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are </p>
<p>married." </p>
<p>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. </p>
<p>"You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have </p>
<p>made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. </p>
<p>Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I </p>
<p>am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is </p>
<p>impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them." </p>
<p>"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal </p>
<p>wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject </p>
<p>the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, </p>
<p>when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the </p>
<p>refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am </p>
<p>therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just </p>
<p>said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long." </p>
<p>"Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is a </p>
<p>rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you </p>
<p>that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies </p>
<p>there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the </p>
<p>chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in </p>
<p>my refusal. You could not make ME happy, and I am </p>
<p>convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could </p>
<p>make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know </p>
<p>me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill </p>
<p>qualified for the situation." </p>
<p>"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said </p>
<p>Mr. Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her </p>
<p>ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be </p>
<p>certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall </p>
<p>speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, </p>
<p>and other amiable qualification." </p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. </p>
<p>You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the </p>
<p>compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy </p>
<p>and very rich, and by refusing you hand, do all in my power to </p>
<p>prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you </p>
<p>must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard </p>
<p>to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate </p>
<p>whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may </p>
<p>be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she </p>
<p>thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins </p>
<p>not thus addressed her: </p>
<p>"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on </p>
<p>the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer </p>
<p>than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing </p>
<p>you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the </p>
<p>established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first </p>
<p>application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to </p>
<p>encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true </p>
<p>delicacy of the female character." </p>
<p>"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, </p>
<p>"you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can </p>
<p>appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how </p>
<p>to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its </p>
<p>being one." </p>
<p>"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, </p>
<p>that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. </p>
<p>My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not </p>
<p>appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or </p>
<p>that the establishment I can offer would be any other than </p>
<p>highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the </p>
<p>family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are </p>
<p>circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it </p>
<p>into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold </p>
<p>attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of </p>
<p>marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so </p>
<p>small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your </p>
<p>loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore </p>
<p>conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I </p>
<p>shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love </p>
<p>by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant </p>
<p>females." </p>
<p>"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to </p>
<p>that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a </p>
<p>respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of </p>
<p>being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the </p>
<p>honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept </p>
<p>them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect </p>
<p>forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an </p>
<p>elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational </p>
<p>creature, speaking the truth from her heart." </p>
<p>"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of </p>
<p>awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned </p>
<p>by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my </p>
<p>proposals will not fail of being acceptable." </p>
<p>To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth </p>
<p>would make no reply, and immediately and in silence </p>
<p>withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her </p>
<p>repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her </p>
<p>father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to </p>
<p>be decisive, and whose behavior at least could not be </p>
<p>mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant </p>
<p>female. </p>

<heading>Chapter 20. </heading>
<p>Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of </p>
<p>his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in </p>
<p>the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner </p>
<p>saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her </p>
<p>towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, </p>
<p>and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the </p>
<p>happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins </p>
<p>received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, </p>
<p>and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, </p>
<p>with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be </p>
<p>satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly </p>
<p>given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and </p>
<p>the genuine delicacy of her character. </p>
<p>This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she </p>
<p>would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter </p>
<p>had meant to encourage him by protesting against his </p>
<p>proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help </p>
<p>saying so. </p>
<p>"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy </p>
<p>shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. </p>
<p>She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her </p>
<p>own interest but I will MAKE her know it." </p>
<p>"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. </p>
<p>Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know </p>
<p>not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a </p>
<p>man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the </p>
<p>marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting </p>
<p>my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting </p>
<p>me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not </p>
<p>contribute much to my felicity." </p>
<p>"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, </p>
<p>alarmed. "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In </p>
<p>everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I </p>
<p>will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it </p>
<p>with her, I am sure." </p>
<p>She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying </p>
<p>instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, </p>
<p>"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in </p>
<p>an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, </p>
<p>for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make </p>
<p>haste he will change his mind and not have HER." </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, </p>
<p>and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was </p>
<p>not in the least altered by her communication. </p>
<p>"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, </p>
<p>when she had finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?" </p>
<p>"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not </p>
<p>have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will </p>
<p>not have Lizzy." </p>
<p>"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an </p>
<p>hopeless business." </p>
<p>"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist </p>
<p>upon her marrying him." </p>
<p>"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion." </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was </p>
<p>summoned to the library. </p>
<p>"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I </p>
<p>have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that </p>
<p>Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" </p>
<p>Elizabeth replied that it was. "Very well--and this offer of </p>
<p>marriage you have refused?" </p>
<p>"I have, sir." </p>
<p>"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother </p>
<p>insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?" </p>
<p>"Yes, or I will never see her again." </p>
<p>"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From </p>
<p>this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. </p>
<p>Your mother will never see you again if you do NOT </p>
<p>marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you </p>
<p>DO." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such </p>
<p>a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that </p>
<p>her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was </p>
<p>excessively disappointed. </p>
<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You </p>
<p>promised me to INSIST upon her marrying him." </p>
<p>"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours </p>
<p>to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my </p>
<p>understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my </p>
<p>room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as </p>
<p>may be." </p>
<p>Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her </p>
<p>husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to </p>
<p>Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. </p>
<p>She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with </p>
<p>all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, </p>
<p>sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful </p>
<p>gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, </p>
<p>however, her determination never did. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on </p>
<p>what had passed. He thought too well of himself to </p>
<p>comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and </p>
<p>though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His </p>
<p>regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her </p>
<p>deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any </p>
<p>regret. </p>
<p>While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas </p>
<p>came to spend the day with them. She was met in the </p>
<p>vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, </p>
<p>"I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do </p>
<p>you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made </p>
<p>an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him." </p>
<p>Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were </p>
<p>joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no </p>
<p>sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, </p>
<p>calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her </p>
<p>to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all </p>
<p>her family. "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a </p>
<p>melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes </p>
<p>part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor </p>
<p>nerves." </p>
<p>Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and </p>
<p>Elizabeth. </p>
<p>"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking </p>
<p>as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if </p>
<p>we were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I </p>
<p>tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it into your head to go on </p>
<p>refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never </p>
<p>get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to </p>
<p>maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to </p>
<p>keep you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this </p>
<p>very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should </p>
<p>never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my </p>
<p>word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not </p>
<p>that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. </p>
<p>People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have </p>
<p>no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! </p>
<p>But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never </p>
<p>pitied." </p>
<p>Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible </p>
<p>that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only </p>
<p>increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without </p>
<p>interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. </p>
<p>Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than </p>
<p>usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "Now, I </p>
<p>do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and </p>
<p>let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together." </p>
<p>Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty </p>
<p>followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all </p>
<p>she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. </p>
<p>Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were </p>
<p>very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself </p>
<p>with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a </p>
<p>doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: </p>
<p>"Oh! Mr. Collins!" </p>
<p>"My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on </p>
<p>this point. Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a </p>
<p>voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of </p>
<p>your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty </p>
<p>of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so </p>
<p>fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am </p>
<p>resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my </p>
<p>positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her </p>
<p>hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so </p>
<p>perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat </p>
<p>of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider </p>
<p>me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, </p>
<p>by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's </p>
<p>favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the </p>
<p>compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in </p>
<p>my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having </p>
<p>accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of </p>
<p>your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant </p>
<p>well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an </p>
<p>amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the </p>
<p>advantage of all your family, and if my MANNER has been at </p>
<p>all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise." </p>

<heading>Chapter 21. </heading>
<p>The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an </p>
<p>end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable </p>
<p>feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some </p>
<p>peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, </p>
<p>HIS feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or </p>
<p>dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner </p>
<p>and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the </p>
<p>assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself </p>
<p>were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose </p>
<p>civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, </p>
<p>and especially to her friend. </p>
<p>The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill- </p>
<p>humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of </p>
<p>angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might </p>
<p>shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least </p>
<p>affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and </p>
<p>to Saturday he meant to stay. </p>
<p>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence </p>
<p>from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the </p>
<p>town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and </p>
<p>vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. </p>
<p>To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the </p>
<p>necessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed. </p>
<p>"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better </p>
<p>not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same </p>
<p>party with him for so many hours together, might be more </p>
<p>than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to </p>
<p>more than myself." </p>
<p>She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure </p>
<p>for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which </p>
<p>they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another </p>
<p>officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the </p>
<p>walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them </p>
<p>was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered </p>
<p>to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of </p>
<p>introducing him to her father and mother. </p>
<p>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss </p>
<p>Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a </p>
<p>sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a </p>
<p>lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's </p>
<p>countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling </p>
<p>intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself </p>
<p>soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual </p>
<p>cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an </p>
<p>anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from </p>
<p>Wickham; and no sooner had he and he companion taken </p>
<p>leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her </p>
<p>upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking </p>
<p>out the letter, said: </p>
<p>"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has </p>
<p>surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left </p>
<p>Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town--and </p>
<p>without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear </p>
<p>what she says." </p>
<p>She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised </p>
<p>the information of their having just resolved to follow their </p>
<p>brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in </p>
<p>Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was </p>
<p>in these words: "I do not pretend to regret anything I shall </p>
<p>leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; </p>
<p>but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns </p>
<p>of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the </p>
<p>meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very </p>
<p>frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on </p>
<p>you for that." To these highflown expressions Elizabeth </p>
<p>listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the </p>
<p>suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in </p>
<p>it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence </p>
<p>from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; </p>
<p>and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane </p>
<p>must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his. </p>
<p>"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you </p>
<p>should not be able to see your friends before they leave the </p>
<p>country. But may we not hope that the period of future </p>
<p>happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive </p>
<p>earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse </p>
<p>you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater </p>
<p>satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in </p>
<p>London by them." </p>
<p>"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return </p>
<p>into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:" </p>
<p>"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the </p>
<p>business which took him to London might be concluded in </p>
<p>three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at </p>
<p>the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he </p>
<p>will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on </p>
<p>following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his </p>
<p>vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my </p>
<p>acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I </p>
<p>could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of </p>
<p>making one of the crowd--but of that I despair. I sincerely </p>
<p>hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the </p>
<p>gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your </p>
<p>beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss </p>
<p>of the three of whom we shall deprive you." </p>
<p>"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no </p>
<p>more this winter." </p>
<p>"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he </p>
<p>SHOULD." </p>
<p>"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is </p>
<p>his own master. But you do not know ALL. I WILL read you </p>
<p>the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no </p>
<p>reserves from YOU." </p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess </p>
<p>the truth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I </p>
<p>really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, </p>
<p>elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires </p>
<p>in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more </p>
<p>interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being </p>
<p>hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before </p>
<p>mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not </p>
<p>leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will </p>
<p>not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her </p>
<p>greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of </p>
<p>seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish </p>
<p>the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is </p>
<p>not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable </p>
<p>of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances </p>
<p>to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I </p>
<p>wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event </p>
<p>which will secure the happiness of so many?" </p>
<p>"What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?" </p>
<p>said Jane as she finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not </p>
<p>expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me </p>
<p>to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's </p>
<p>indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings </p>
<p>for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? </p>
<p>Can there be any other opinion on the subject?" </p>
<p>"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear </p>
<p>it?" </p>
<p>"Most willingly." </p>
<p>"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that </p>
<p>her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss </p>
<p>Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, </p>
<p>and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you." </p>
<p>Jane shook her head. </p>
<p>"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has </p>
<p>ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, </p>
<p>I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have </p>
<p>seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would </p>
<p>have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are </p>
<p>not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more </p>
<p>anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that </p>
<p>when there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less </p>
<p>trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some </p>
<p>ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh </p>
<p>were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot </p>
<p>seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her </p>
<p>brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest </p>
<p>degree less sensible of YOUR merit than when he took leave </p>
<p>of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade </p>
<p>him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in </p>
<p>love with her friend." </p>
<p>"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your </p>
<p>representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I </p>
<p>know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of </p>
<p>wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case </p>
<p>is that she is deceiving herself." </p>
<p>"That is right. You could not have started a more happy </p>
<p>idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to </p>
<p>be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by </p>
<p>her, and must fret no longer." </p>
<p>"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the </p>
<p>best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all </p>
<p>wishing him to marry elsewhere?" </p>
<p>"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth; "and if, </p>
<p>upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of </p>
<p>disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the </p>
<p>happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to </p>
<p>refuse him." </p>
<p>"How can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. "You </p>
<p>must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at </p>
<p>their disapprobation, I could not hesitate." </p>
<p>"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I </p>
<p>cannot consider your situation with much compassion." </p>
<p>"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will </p>
<p>never be required. A thousand things may arise in six </p>
<p>months!" </p>
<p>The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with </p>
<p>the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion </p>
<p>of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a </p>
<p>moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully </p>
<p>spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent </p>
<p>of everyone. </p>
<p>She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what </p>
<p>she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its </p>
<p>happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was </p>
<p>gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection </p>
<p>sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to </p>
<p>Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. </p>
<p>They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the </p>
<p>departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of </p>
<p>the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication </p>
<p>gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as </p>
<p>exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away </p>
<p>just as they were all getting so intimate together. After </p>
<p>lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation </p>
<p>that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining </p>
<p>at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable </p>
<p>declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family </p>
<p>dinner, she would take care to have two full courses. </p>

<heading>Chapter 22. </heading>
<p>The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and </p>
<p>again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to </p>
<p>listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of </p>
<p>thanking her. "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I </p>
<p>am more obliged to you than I can express." Charlotte assured </p>
<p>her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply </p>
<p>repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very </p>
<p>amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than </p>
<p>Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else </p>
<p>than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, </p>
<p>by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's </p>
<p>scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they </p>
<p>parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if </p>
<p>he had </p>
<p>not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did </p>
<p>injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it </p>
<p>led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning </p>
<p>with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw </p>
<p>himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his </p>
<p>cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they </p>
<p>could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing </p>
<p>to have the attempt known till its success might be known </p>
<p>likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, </p>
<p>for Charlotte had been tolerably </p>
<p>encouraging, he was </p>
<p>comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. </p>
<p>His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss </p>
<p>Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked </p>
<p>towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him </p>
<p>accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that </p>
<p>so much love and eloquence awaited her there. </p>
<p>In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would </p>
<p>allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction </p>
<p>of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated </p>
<p>her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of </p>
<p>men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the </p>
<p>present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his </p>
<p>happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by </p>
<p>nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could </p>
<p>make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who </p>
<p>accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of </p>
<p>an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were </p>
<p>gained. </p>
<p>Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for </p>
<p>their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible </p>
<p>match for their daughter, to whom they could give little </p>
<p>fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly </p>
<p>fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more </p>
<p>interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many </p>
<p>years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William </p>
<p>gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins </p>
<p>should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be </p>
<p>highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their </p>
<p>appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were </p>
<p>properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed </p>
<p>hopes of COM ING OUT a year or two sooner than they </p>
<p>might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from </p>
<p>their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte </p>
<p>herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and </p>
<p>had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general </p>
<p>satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor </p>
<p>agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her </p>
<p>must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. </p>
<p>Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage </p>
<p>had always been her object; it was the only provision for well- </p>
<p>educated young women of small fortune, and however </p>
<p>uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest </p>
<p>preservative from want. This preservative she had now </p>
<p>obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever </p>
<p>been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least </p>
<p>agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it </p>
<p>must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she </p>
<p>valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would </p>
<p>wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her </p>
<p>resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by </p>
<p>such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the </p>
<p>information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when </p>
<p>he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what </p>
<p>had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy </p>
<p>was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept </p>
<p>without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long </p>
<p>absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return </p>
<p>as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same </p>
<p>time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish </p>
<p>his prosperous love. </p>
<p>As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to </p>
<p>see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was </p>
<p>performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy </p>
<p>they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his </p>
<p>engagements might allow him to visit them. </p>
<p>"My </p>
<p>dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is </p>
<p>particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping </p>
<p>to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail </p>
<p>myself of it as soon as possible." </p>
<p>They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by </p>
<p>no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said: </p>
<p>"But is there not danger of </p>
<p>Lady Catherine's </p>
<p>disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your </p>
<p>relations than run the risk of offending your patroness." </p>
<p>"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins," I am particularly </p>
<p>obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend </p>
<p>upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's </p>
<p>concurrence." </p>
<p>"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything </p>
<p>rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be </p>
<p>raised by your coming to us again, which I should think </p>
<p>exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied </p>
<p>that WE shall take no offence." </p>
<p>"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited </p>
<p>by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will </p>
<p>speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for </p>
<p>every other mark of your regard during my stay in </p>
<p>Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may </p>
<p>not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the </p>
<p>liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting </p>
<p>my cousin Elizabeth." </p>
<p>With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them </p>
<p>equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying </p>
<p>his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might </p>
<p>have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities </p>
<p>much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his </p>
<p>reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so </p>
<p>clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and </p>
<p>improve himself by such an example as hers, he might </p>
<p>become a very agreeable companion. But on the following </p>
<p>morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas </p>
<p>called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with </p>
<p>Elizabeth related the event of the day before. </p>
<p>The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying herself in love </p>
<p>with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last </p>
<p>day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed </p>
<p>almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him </p>
<p>herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to </p>
<p>overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not </p>
<p>help crying out: </p>
<p>"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!" </p>
<p>The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had </p>
<p>commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary </p>
<p>confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it </p>
<p>was no more than she expected, she soon regained her </p>
<p>composure, and calmly replied: </p>
<p>"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you </p>
<p>think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure </p>
<p>any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to </p>
<p>succeed with you?" </p>
<p>But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a </p>
<p>strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness </p>
<p>that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to </p>
<p>her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. </p>
<p>"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must </p>
<p>be surprised, very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins </p>
<p>was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to </p>
<p>think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have </p>
<p>done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a </p>
<p>comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, </p>
<p>connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my </p>
<p>chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can </p>
<p>boast on entering the marriage state." </p>
<p>Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an </p>
<p>awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. </p>
<p>Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then </p>
<p>left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before </p>
<p>she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a </p>
<p>match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of </p>
<p>marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his </p>
<p>being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's </p>
<p>opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she </p>
<p>had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into </p>
<p>action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to </p>
<p>worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a </p>
<p>most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend </p>
<p>disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the </p>
<p>distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to </p>
<p>be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen. </p>
<heading>Chapter 23. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting </p>
<p>on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was </p>
<p>authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself </p>
<p>appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement </p>
<p>to the family. With many compliments to them, and much </p>
<p>self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the </p>
<p>houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely </p>
<p>wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more </p>
<p>perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely </p>
<p>mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, </p>
<p>boisterously exclaimed: </p>
<p>"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? </p>
<p>Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?" </p>
<p>Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could </p>
<p>have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's </p>
<p>good breeding carried him through it all; and though he </p>
<p>begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, </p>
<p>he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing </p>
<p>courtesy. </p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from </p>
<p>so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm </p>
<p>his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from </p>
<p>Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the </p>
<p>exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of </p>
<p>her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily </p>
<p>joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the </p>
<p>happiness that might be expected from the match, the </p>
<p>excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance </p>
<p>of Hunsford from London. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a </p>
<p>great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he </p>
<p>left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first </p>
<p>place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; </p>
<p>secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken </p>
<p>in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy </p>
<p>together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. </p>
<p>Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the </p>
<p>whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; </p>
<p>and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused </p>
<p>by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt </p>
<p>during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing </p>
<p>could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. </p>
<p>A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without </p>
<p>scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to </p>
<p>Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many </p>
<p>months were gone before she could at all forgive their </p>
<p>daughter. </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the </p>
<p>occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be </p>
<p>of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to </p>
<p>discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to </p>
<p>think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more </p>
<p>foolish than his daughter! </p>
<p>Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but </p>
<p>she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for </p>
<p>their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider </p>
<p>it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss </p>
<p>Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected </p>
<p>them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at </p>
<p>Meryton. </p>
<p>Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being </p>
<p>able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter </p>
<p>well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than </p>
<p>usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour </p>
<p>looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to </p>
<p>drive happiness away. </p>
<p>Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint </p>
<p>which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth </p>
<p>felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist </p>
<p>between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made </p>
<p>her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude </p>
<p>and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, </p>
<p>and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as </p>
<p>Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was </p>
<p>heard of his return. </p>
<p>Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and </p>
<p>was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear </p>
<p>again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived </p>
<p>on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the </p>
<p>solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the </p>
<p>family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience </p>
<p>on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many </p>
<p>rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the </p>
<p>affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then </p>
<p>explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her </p>
<p>society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish </p>
<p>of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be </p>
<p>able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he </p>
<p>added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to </p>
<p>take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an </p>
<p>unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an </p>
<p>early day for making him the happiest of men. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a </p>
<p>matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as </p>
<p>much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very </p>
<p>strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas </p>
<p>Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly </p>
<p>troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her </p>
<p>health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the </p>
<p>most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley's continued absence. </p>
<p>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this </p>
<p>subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other </p>
<p>tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in </p>
<p>Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole w </p>
<p>inter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which </p>
<p>she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. </p>
<p>Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was </p>
<p>indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping </p>
<p>him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so </p>
<p>destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the </p>
<p>stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently </p>
<p>occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and </p>
<p>of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss </p>
<p>Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she </p>
<p>feared, for the strength of his attachment. </p>
<p>As for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of </p>
<p>course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt </p>
<p>she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and </p>
<p>Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as </p>
<p>no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed </p>
<p>in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience </p>
<p>for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did </p>
<p>not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed </p>
<p>all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable </p>
<p>tranquillity. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, </p>
<p>but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it </p>
<p>had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, </p>
<p>however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, </p>
<p>the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal </p>
<p>of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at </p>
<p>Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only </p>
<p>in time to make an apology for his absence before the family </p>
<p>went to bed. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very </p>
<p>mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an </p>
<p>agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of </p>
<p>hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to </p>
<p>her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with </p>
<p>jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, </p>
<p>she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; </p>
<p>and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was </p>
<p>convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and </p>
<p>resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as </p>
<p>soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all </p>
<p>this to her husband. </p>
<p>"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think </p>
<p>that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, </p>
<p>that I should be forced to make way for HER, and live to see </p>
<p>her take her place in it!" </p>
<p>"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let </p>
<p>us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be </p>
<p>the survivor." </p>
<p>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, </p>
<p>instead of making any answer, she went on as before. </p>
<p>"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. </p>
<p>If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it." </p>
<p>"What should not you mind?" </p>
<p>"I should not mind anything at all." </p>
<p>"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of </p>
<p>such insensibility." </p>
<p>"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about </p>
<p>the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail </p>
<p>away an estate from one's </p>
<p>own daughters, I cannot </p>
<p>understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why </p>
<p>should HE have it more than anybody else?" </p>
<p>"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet. </p>
<heading>Chapter 24. </heading>
<p>Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The </p>
<p>very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all </p>
<p>settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her </p>
<p>brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to </p>
<p>his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country. </p>
<p>Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend </p>
<p>to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed </p>
<p>affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss </p>
<p>Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions </p>
<p>were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their </p>
<p>increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the </p>
<p>accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her </p>
<p>former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her </p>
<p>brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and </p>
<p>mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard </p>
<p>to new furniture. </p>
<p>Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the </p>
<p>chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was </p>
<p>divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against </p>
<p>all others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial </p>
<p>to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of </p>
<p>Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much </p>
<p>as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not </p>
<p>think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness </p>
<p>of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made </p>
<p>him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice </p>
<p>of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had </p>
<p>his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might </p>
<p>have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he </p>
<p>thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought </p>
<p>he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on </p>
<p>which reflection would be long indulged, and must be </p>
<p>unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet whether </p>
<p>Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by </p>
<p>his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's </p>
<p>attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; </p>
<p>whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be </p>
<p>materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation </p>
<p>remained the same, her peace equally wounded. </p>
<p>A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of </p>
<p>her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving </p>
<p>them together, after a longer irritation than usual about </p>
<p>Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying: </p>
<p>"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! </p>
<p>She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her </p>
<p>continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot </p>
<p>last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were </p>
<p>before." </p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, </p>
<p>but said nothing. </p>
<p>"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed, </p>
<p>you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most </p>
<p>amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have </p>
<p>nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him </p>
<p>with. Thank God! I have not THAT pain. A little time, </p>
<p>therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better." </p>
<p>With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort </p>
<p>immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy </p>
<p>on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but </p>
<p>myself." </p>
<p>"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. </p>
<p>Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do </p>
<p>not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you </p>
<p>justice, or loved you as you deserve." </p>
<p>Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, </p>
<p>and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection. </p>
<p>"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. YOU wish to think </p>
<p>all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of </p>
<p>anybody. I only want to think YOU perfect, and you set </p>
<p>yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any </p>
<p>excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal </p>
<p>good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really </p>
<p>love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of </p>
<p>the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day </p>
<p>confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human </p>
<p>characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on </p>
<p>the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two </p>
<p>instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's </p>
<p>marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is </p>
<p>unaccountable!" </p>
<p>"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. </p>
<p>They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance </p>
<p>enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. </p>
<p>Collins's respectability, </p>
<p>and Charlotte's steady, prudent </p>
<p>character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as </p>
<p>to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, </p>
<p>for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard </p>
<p>and esteem for our cousin." </p>
<p>"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but </p>
<p>no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for </p>
<p>were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I </p>
<p>should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of </p>
<p>her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, </p>
<p>narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; </p>
<p>and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who </p>
<p>married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall </p>
<p>not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for </p>
<p>the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle </p>
<p>and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that </p>
<p>selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security </p>
<p>for happiness." </p>
<p>"I must think your language too strong in speaking of </p>
<p>both," replied Jane; "and I hope you will be convinced of it by </p>
<p>seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded </p>
<p>to something else. You mentioned TWO instances. I cannot </p>
<p>misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain </p>
<p>me by thinking THAT PERSON to blame, and saying your </p>
<p>opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy </p>
<p>ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively </p>
<p>young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is </p>
<p>very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. </p>
<p>Women fancy admiration means more than it does." </p>
<p>"And men take care that they should." </p>
<p>"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I </p>
<p>have no idea of there being so much design in the world as </p>
<p>some persons imagine." </p>
<p>"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's </p>
<p>conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to </p>
<p>do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and </p>
<p>there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to </p>
<p>other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the </p>
<p>business." </p>
<p>"And do you impute it to either of those?" </p>
<p>"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by </p>
<p>saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst </p>
<p>you can." </p>
<p>"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?" </p>
<p>"Yes, in conjunction with his friend." </p>
<p>"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? </p>
<p>They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, </p>
<p>no other woman can secure it." </p>
<p>"Your first position is false. They may wish many things </p>
<p>besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth </p>
<p>and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has </p>
<p>all the importance of money, great connections, and pride." </p>
<p>"Beyond a doubt, they DO wish him to choose Miss </p>
<p>Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings </p>
<p>than you are supposing. They have known her much longer </p>
<p>than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. </p>
<p>But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely </p>
<p>they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would </p>
<p>think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something </p>
<p>very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they </p>
<p>would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. </p>
<p>By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting </p>
<p>unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress </p>
<p>me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken-- </p>
<p>or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I </p>
<p>should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it </p>
<p>in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between </p>
<p>them. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his </p>
<p>returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which </p>
<p>Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance </p>
<p>of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter </p>
<p>endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe </p>
<p>herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect </p>
<p>of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw </p>
<p>her no more; but though the probability of the statement was </p>
<p>admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every </p>
<p>day. Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be </p>
<p>down again in the summer. </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said </p>
<p>he one day, </p>
<p>"your sister is crossed in love, I find. I </p>
<p>congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be </p>
<p>crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think </p>
<p>of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her </p>
<p>companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear </p>
<p>to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are </p>
<p>officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies </p>
<p>in the country. Let Wickham be YOUR man. He is a pleasant </p>
<p>fellow, and would jilt you creditably." </p>
<p>"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy </p>
<p>me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune." </p>
<p>"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that </p>
<p>whatever of that kind may befall </p>
<p>you, </p>
<p>you have an </p>
<p>affectionate mother who will make the most of it." </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in </p>
<p>dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had </p>
<p>thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him </p>
<p>often, and to his other recommendations was now added that </p>
<p>of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had </p>
<p>already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had </p>
<p>suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and </p>
<p>publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how </p>
<p>much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had </p>
<p>known anything of the matter. </p>
<p>Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose </p>
<p>there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, </p>
<p>unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady </p>
<p>candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the </p>
<p>possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was </p>
<p>condemned as the worst of men. </p>
<heading>Chapter 25. </heading>
<p>After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of </p>
<p>felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by </p>
<p>the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, </p>
<p>might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the </p>
<p>reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly </p>
<p>after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that </p>
<p>was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his </p>
<p>relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; </p>
<p>wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and </p>
<p>promised their father another letter of thanks. </p>
<p>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of </p>
<p>receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to </p>
<p>spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a </p>
<p>sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as </p>
<p>well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would </p>
<p>have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, </p>
<p>and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so </p>
<p>well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several </p>
<p>years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an </p>
<p>amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite </p>
<p>with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and </p>
<p>herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They </p>
<p>had frequently been staying with her in town. </p>
<p>The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival </p>
<p>was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fash </p>
<p>ions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It </p>
<p>became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to </p>
<p>relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill- </p>
<p>used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been </p>
<p>upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in </p>
<p>it. </p>
<p>"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have </p>
<p>got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very </p>
<p>hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by </p>
<p>this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made </p>
<p>her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The </p>
<p>consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter </p>
<p>married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as </p>
<p>much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people </p>
<p>indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to </p>
<p>say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and </p>
<p>poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have </p>
<p>neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. </p>
<p>However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of </p>
<p>comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long </p>
<p>sleeves." </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been </p>
<p>given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's </p>
<p>correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, </p>
<p>in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation. </p>
<p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on </p>
<p>the subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for </p>
<p>Jane," said she. "I am sorry it went off. But these things </p>
<p>happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few </p>
<p>weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets </p>
<p>her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent." </p>
<p>"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but </p>
<p>it will not do for US. We do not suffer by ACCIDENT. It </p>
<p>does not often happen that the interference of friends will </p>
<p>persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no </p>
<p>more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few </p>
<p>days before." </p>
<p>"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, </p>
<p>so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is </p>
<p>as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's </p>
<p>acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how </p>
<p>VIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley's love?" </p>
<p>"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing </p>
<p>quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. </p>
<p>Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At </p>
<p>his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not </p>
<p>asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, </p>
<p>without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? </p>
<p>Is not general incivility the very essence of love?" </p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to </p>
<p>have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her </p>
<p>disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better </p>
<p>have happened to YOU, Lizzy; you would have laughed </p>
<p>yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be </p>
<p>prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be </p>
<p>of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as </p>
<p>useful as anything." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and </p>
<p>felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence. </p>
<p>"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with </p>
<p>regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so </p>
<p>different a part of town, all our connections are so different, </p>
<p>and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very </p>
<p>improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really </p>
<p>comes to see her." </p>
<p>"And THAT is quite impossible; for he is now in the </p>
<p>custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer </p>
<p>him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, </p>
<p>how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have </p>
<p>HEARD of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would </p>
<p>hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from </p>
<p>its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley never stirs without him." </p>
<p>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But </p>
<p>does not Jane correspond with his sister? SHE will not be able </p>
<p>to help calling." </p>
<p>"She will drop the acquaintance entirely." </p>
<p>But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to </p>
<p>place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of </p>
<p>Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a </p>
<p>solicitude on the subject which convinced </p>
<p>her, on </p>
<p>examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It </p>
<p>was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his </p>
<p>affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends </p>
<p>successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's </p>
<p>attractions. </p>
<p>Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; </p>
<p>and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the </p>
<p>same time, than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the </p>
<p>same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a </p>
<p>morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. </p>
<p>The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with </p>
<p>the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a </p>
<p>day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully </p>
<p>provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that </p>
<p>they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the </p>
<p>engagement was for home, some of the officers always made </p>
<p>part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; </p>
<p>and on these occasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by </p>
<p>Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them </p>
<p>both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very </p>
<p>seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain </p>
<p>enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak </p>
<p>to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and </p>
<p>represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an </p>
<p>attachment. </p>
<p>To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording </p>
<p>pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a </p>
<p>dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a </p>
<p>considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he </p>
<p>belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in </p>
<p>common; and though Wickham had been little there since the </p>
<p>death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her </p>
<p>fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in </p>
<p>the way of procuring. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an </p>
<p>inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her </p>
<p>recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which </p>
<p>Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on </p>
<p>the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him </p>
<p>and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that </p>
<p>gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might </p>
<p>agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected </p>
<p>having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a </p>
<p>very proud, ill-natured boy. </p>

<p>Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and </p>
<p>kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to </p>
<p>her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus </p>
<p>went on: </p>
<p>"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely </p>
<p>because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not </p>
<p>afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on </p>
<p>your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve </p>
<p>him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so </p>
<p>very imprudent. I have nothing to say against HIM; he is a </p>
<p>most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he </p>
<p>ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it </p>
<p>is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have </p>
<p>sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would </p>
<p>depend on YOUR resolution and good conduct, I am sure. </p>
<p>You must not disappoint your father." </p>
<p>"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed." </p>
<p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise." </p>
<p>"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take </p>
<p>care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in </p>
<p>love with me, if I can prevent it." </p>
<p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now." </p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in </p>
<p>love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, </p>
<p>beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw-- </p>
<p>and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be </p>
<p>better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! </p>
<p>THAT abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me </p>
<p>does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to </p>
<p>forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In </p>
<p>short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of </p>
<p>making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that </p>
<p>where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by </p>
<p>immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements </p>
<p>with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many </p>
<p>of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to </p>
<p>know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise </p>
<p>you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry </p>
<p>to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with </p>
<p>him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best." </p>
<p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming </p>
<p>here so very often. At least, you should not REMIND you </p>
<p>mother of inviting him." </p>
<p>"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a conscious </p>
<p>smile: "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT. </p>
<p>But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on </p>
<p>your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. </p>
<p>You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant </p>
<p>company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I </p>
<p>will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope </p>
<p>you are satisfied." </p>
<p>Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having </p>
<p>thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a </p>
<p>wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, </p>
<p>without being resented. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had </p>
<p>been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his </p>
<p>abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great </p>
<p>inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast </p>
<p>approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think </p>
<p>it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, </p>
<p>that she "WISHED they might be happy." Thursday was to be </p>
<p>the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her </p>
<p>farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, </p>
<p>ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good </p>
<p>wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of </p>
<p>the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said: </p>
<p>"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza." </p>
<p>"THAT you certainly shall." </p>
<p>"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and </p>
<p>see me?" </p>
<p>"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire." </p>
<p>"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, </p>
<p>therefore, to come to Hunsford." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little </p>
<p>pleasure in the visit. </p>
<p>"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added </p>
<p>Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. </p>
<p>Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them." </p>
<p>The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off </p>
<p>for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to </p>
<p>say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard </p>
<p>from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and </p>
<p>frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally </p>
<p>unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her </p>
<p>without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and </p>
<p>though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was </p>
<p>for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. </p>
<p>Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of </p>
<p>eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she </p>
<p>would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady </p>
<p>Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself </p>
<p>to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that </p>
<p>Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she </p>
<p>might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed </p>
<p>surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she </p>
<p>could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and </p>
<p>roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour </p>
<p>was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of </p>
<p>Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth </p>
<p>perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know </p>
<p>the rest. </p>
<p>Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to </p>
<p>announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote </p>
<p>again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say </p>
<p>something of the Bingleys. </p>
<p>Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded </p>
<p>as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town </p>
<p>without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted </p>
<p>for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend </p>
<p>from Longbourn had by some accident been lost. </p>
<p>"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that </p>
<p>part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in </p>
<p>Grosvenor Street." </p>
<p>She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen </p>
<p>Miss Bingley. "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her </p>
<p>words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me </p>
<p>for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, </p>
<p>therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after </p>
<p>their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged </p>
<p>with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that </p>
<p>Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My </p>
<p>visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. </p>
<p>I dare say I shall see them soon here." </p>
<p>Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her </p>
<p>that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's </p>
<p>being in town. </p>
<p>Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. </p>
<p>She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; </p>
<p>but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. </p>
<p>After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and </p>
<p>inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did </p>
<p>at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the </p>
<p>alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself </p>
<p>no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her </p>
<p>sister will prove what she felt. </p>
<p>"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of </p>
<p>triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I </p>
<p>confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss </p>
<p>Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event </p>
<p>has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert </p>
<p>that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was </p>
<p>as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her </p>
<p>reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same </p>
<p>circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be </p>
<p>deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; </p>
<p>and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When </p>
<p>she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in </p>
<p>it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, </p>
<p>said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every </p>
<p>respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was </p>
<p>perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I </p>
<p>pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in </p>
<p>singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance </p>
<p>to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she </p>
<p>must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am </p>
<p>very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need </p>
<p>not explain myself farther; and though WE know this anxiety </p>
<p>to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account </p>
<p>for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his </p>
<p>sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural </p>
<p>and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any </p>
<p>such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we </p>
<p>must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am </p>
<p>certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would </p>
<p>seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade </p>
<p>herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot </p>
<p>understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should </p>
<p>be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of </p>
<p>duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every </p>
<p>painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy-- </p>
<p>your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle </p>
<p>and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said </p>
<p>something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of </p>
<p>giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better </p>
<p>not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such </p>
<p>pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see </p>
<p>them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very </p>
<p>comfortable there.--Yours, etc." </p>
<p>This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits </p>
<p>returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be </p>
<p>duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother </p>
<p>was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a </p>
<p>renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review </p>
<p>of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible </p>
<p>advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon </p>
<p>marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would </p>
<p>make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her </p>
<p>promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; </p>
<p>and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give </p>
<p>contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality </p>
<p>had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of </p>
<p>some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but </p>
<p>she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her </p>
<p>heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was </p>
<p>satisfied with believing that SHE would have been his only </p>
<p>choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten </p>
<p>thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young </p>
<p>lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but </p>
<p>Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in </p>
<p>Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of </p>
<p>independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more </p>
<p>natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few </p>
<p>struggle to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and </p>
<p>desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him </p>
<p>happy. </p>
<p>All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after </p>
<p>relating the circumstances, she thus went on: "I am now </p>
<p>convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; </p>
<p>for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I </p>
<p>should at present detest his very name, and wish him all </p>
<p>manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards </p>
<p>HIM; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot </p>
<p>find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling </p>
<p>to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in </p>
<p>all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I </p>
<p>certainly should be a more interesting object to all my </p>
<p>acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot </p>
<p>say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance </p>
<p>may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take </p>
<p>his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in </p>
<p>the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying </p>
<p>conviction that handsome young men must have something to </p>
<p>live on as well as the plain." </p>
<heading>Chapter 27. </heading>
<p>With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, </p>
<p>and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to </p>
<p>Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January </p>
<p>and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to </p>
<p>Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going </p>
<p>thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the </p>
<p>plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with </p>
<p>greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had </p>
<p>increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened </p>
<p>her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, </p>
<p>and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, </p>
<p>home could not be faultless, a little change was not </p>
<p>unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover </p>
<p>give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, </p>
<p>she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, </p>
<p>however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according </p>
<p>to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William </p>
<p>and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a </p>
<p>night in London was added in time, and the plan became </p>
<p>perfect as plan could be. </p>
<p>The only pain was in leaving her father, who would </p>
<p>certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so </p>
<p>little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and </p>
<p>almost promised to answer her letter. </p>
<p>The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was </p>
<p>perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit </p>
<p>could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to </p>
<p>excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to </p>
<p>pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her </p>
<p>adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what </p>
<p>she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting </p>
<p>their opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would </p>
<p>always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she </p>
<p>felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; </p>
<p>and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or </p>
<p>single, he must always be her model of the amiable and </p>
<p>pleasing. </p>
<p>Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to </p>
<p>make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his </p>
<p>daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed </p>
<p>as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, </p>
<p>and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of </p>
<p>the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir </p>
<p>William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the </p>
<p>wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities </p>
<p>were worn out, like his information. </p>
<p>It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began </p>
<p>it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they </p>
<p>drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room </p>
<p>window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage </p>
<p>she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking </p>
<p>earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely </p>
<p>as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, </p>
<p>whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not </p>
<p>allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, </p>
<p>as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their </p>
<p>coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most </p>
<p>pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the </p>
<p>evening at one of the theatres. </p>
<p>Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first </p>
<p>object was her sister; and she was more grieved than </p>
<p>astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that </p>
<p>though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were </p>
<p>periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that </p>
<p>they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the </p>
<p>particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, </p>
<p>and repeated conversations occurring at different times </p>
<p>between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, </p>
<p>from her heart, given up the acquaintance. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's </p>
<p>desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well. </p>
<p>"But my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is </p>
<p>Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary." </p>
<p>"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial </p>
<p>affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? </p>
<p>Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas </p>
<p>you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be </p>
<p>imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with </p>
<p>only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is </p>
<p>mercenary." </p>
<p>"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I </p>
<p>shall know what to think." </p>
<p>"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm </p>
<p>of her." </p>
<p>"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her </p>
<p>grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune." </p>
<p>"No--what should he? If it were not allowable for him to </p>
<p>gain MY affections because I had no money, what occasion </p>
<p>could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care </p>
<p>about, and who was equally poor?" </p>
<p>"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions </p>
<p>towards her so soon after this event." </p>
<p>"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all </p>
<p>those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If </p>
<p>SHE does not object to it, why should WE?" </p>
<p>"HER not objecting does not justify HIM. It only shows </p>
<p>her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling." </p>
<p>"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. HE shall </p>
<p>be mercenary, and SHE shall be foolish." </p>
<p>"No, Lizzy, that is what I do NOT choose. I should be </p>
<p>sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so </p>
<p>long in Derbyshire." </p>
<p>"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men </p>
<p>who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in </p>
<p>Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. </p>
<p>Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a </p>
<p>man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither </p>
<p>manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only </p>
<p>ones worth knowing, after all." </p>
<p>"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of </p>
<p>disappointment." </p>
<p>Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, </p>
<p>she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to </p>
<p>accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which </p>
<p>they proposed taking in the summer. </p>
<p>"We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, "but, perhaps, to the Lakes." </p>
<p>No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, </p>
<p>and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and </p>
<p>grateful. </p>
<p>"Oh, my dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what </p>
<p>delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. </p>
<p>Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to </p>
<p>rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall </p>
<p>spend! And when we DO return, it shall not be like other </p>
<p>travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of </p>
<p>anything. We WILL know where we have gone--we WILL </p>
<p>recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers </p>
<p>shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when </p>
<p>we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin </p>
<p>quarreling about its relative situation. Let OUR first effusions </p>
<p>be less insupportable than those of the generality </p>
<p>of </p>
<p>travellers." </p>

<heading>Chapter 28. </heading>
<p>Every object in the next day's journey was new and </p>
<p>interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of </p>
<p>enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to </p>
<p>banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern </p>
<p>tour was a constant source of delight. </p>
<p>When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, </p>
<p>every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning </p>
<p>expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was </p>
<p>their boundary </p>
<p>on </p>
<p>one </p>
<p>side. Elizabeth smiled at the </p>
<p>recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants. </p>
<p>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden </p>
<p>sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, </p>
<p>and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. </p>
<p>Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the </p>
<p>carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel </p>
<p>walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole </p>
<p>party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at </p>
<p>the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with </p>
<p>the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more </p>
<p>satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately </p>
<p>received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not </p>
<p>altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it </p>
<p>had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear </p>
<p>and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, </p>
<p>with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the </p>
<p>entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the </p>
<p>parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious </p>
<p>formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his </p>
<p>wife's offers of refreshment. </p>
<p>Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she </p>
<p>could not help in fancying that in displaying the good </p>
<p>proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he </p>
<p>addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make </p>
<p>her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though </p>
<p>everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to </p>
<p>gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with </p>
<p>wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air </p>
<p>with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of </p>
<p>which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly </p>
<p>was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on </p>
<p>Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in </p>
<p>general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long </p>
<p>enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from </p>
<p>the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their </p>
<p>journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins </p>
<p>invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large </p>
<p>and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended </p>
<p>himself. To work in this garden was one of his most </p>
<p>respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of </p>
<p>countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness </p>
<p>of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as </p>
<p>possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross </p>
<p>walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the </p>
<p>praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a </p>
<p>minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could </p>
<p>number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many </p>
<p>tress there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views </p>
<p>which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could </p>
<p>boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of </p>
<p>Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the </p>
<p>park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome </p>
<p>modern building, well situated on rising ground. </p>
<p>From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round </p>
<p>his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to </p>
<p>encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while </p>
<p>Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and </p>
<p>friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to </p>
<p>have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help. </p>
<p>It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and </p>
<p>everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and </p>
<p>consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. </p>
<p>When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air </p>
<p>of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's </p>
<p>evident </p>
<p>enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often </p>
<p>forgotten. </p>
<p>She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the </p>
<p>country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, </p>
<p>when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: </p>
<p>"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing </p>
<p>Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, </p>
<p>and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all </p>
<p>affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be </p>
<p>honoured with some portion of her notice when service is </p>
<p>over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include </p>
<p>you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she </p>
<p>honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear </p>
<p>Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, </p>
<p>and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage </p>
<p>is regularly ordered for us. I SHOULD say, one of her </p>
<p>ladyship's carriages, for she has several." </p>
<p>"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman </p>
<p>indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour." </p>
<p>"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the </p>
<p>sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much </p>
<p>deference." </p>
<p>The evening was spent chiefly in talking over </p>
<p>Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been </p>
<p>written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her </p>
<p>chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's </p>
<p>degree of </p>
<p>contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and </p>
<p>composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge </p>
<p>that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how </p>
<p>her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual </p>
<p>employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and </p>
<p>the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively </p>
<p>imagination soon settled it all. </p>
<p>About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room </p>
<p>getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to </p>
<p>speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a </p>
<p>moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent </p>
<p>hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and </p>
<p>met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, </p>
<p>cried out- </p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the </p>
<p>dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell </p>
<p>you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment." </p>
<p>Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her </p>
<p>nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which </p>
<p>fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies </p>
<p>stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate. </p>
<p>"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that </p>
<p>the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but </p>
<p>Lady Catherine and her daughter." </p>
<p>"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it </p>
<p>is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who </p>
<p>lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at </p>
<p>her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought </p>
<p>that she could be so thin and small?" </p>
<p>"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in </p>
<p>all this wind. Why does she not come in?" </p>
<p>"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest </p>
<p>of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in." </p>
<p>"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other </p>
<p>ideas. "She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him </p>
<p>very well. She will make him a very proper wife." </p>
<p>Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in </p>
<p>conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's </p>
<p>high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest </p>
<p>contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly </p>
<p>bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way. </p>
<p>At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies </p>
<p>drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins </p>
<p>no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate </p>
<p>them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by </p>
<p>letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at </p>
<p>Rosings the next day. </p>
<heading>Chapter 29. </heading>
<p>Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, </p>
<p>was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his </p>
<p>patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see </p>
<p>her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he </p>
<p>had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be </p>
<p>given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's </p>
<p>condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough. </p>
<p>"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all </p>
<p>surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea </p>
<p>and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my </p>
<p>knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who </p>
<p>could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have </p>
<p>imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an </p>
<p>invitation, moreover, including the whole party) </p>
<p>so </p>
<p>immediately after your arrival!" </p>
<p>"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir </p>
<p>William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the </p>
<p>great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to </p>
<p>acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding </p>
<p>are not uncommon." </p>
<p>Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next </p>
<p>morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully </p>
<p>instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of </p>
<p>such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might </p>
<p>not wholly overpower them. </p>
<p>When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to </p>
<p>Elizabeth- </p>
<p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your </p>
<p>apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of </p>
<p>dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would </p>
<p>advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is </p>
<p>superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more. </p>
<p>Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being </p>
<p>simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank </p>
<p>preserved." </p>
<p>While they were dressing, he came two or three times to </p>
<p>their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady </p>
<p>Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her </p>
<p>dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her </p>
<p>manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been </p>
<p>little used to company, and she looked forward to her </p>
<p>introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her </p>
<p>father had done to his presentation at St. James's. </p>
<p>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about </p>
<p>half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its </p>
<p>prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though </p>
<p>she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the </p>
<p>scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his </p>
<p>enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his </p>
<p>relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir </p>
<p>Lewis de Bourgh. </p>
<p>When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm </p>
<p>was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not </p>
<p>look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She </p>
<p>had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful </p>
<p>from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the </p>
<p>mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could </p>
<p>witness without trepidation. </p>
<p>From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, </p>
<p>with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished </p>
<p>ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante- </p>
<p>chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, </p>
<p>and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great </p>
<p>condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had </p>
<p>settled it with her husband that the office of introduction </p>
<p>should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without </p>
<p>any of those apologies and thanks which he would have </p>
<p>thought necessary. </p>
<p>In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so </p>
<p>completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he </p>
<p>had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take </p>
<p>his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened </p>
<p>almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not </p>
<p>knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite </p>
<p>equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before </p>
<p>her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with </p>
<p>strongly-marked features, which might once have been </p>
<p>handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner </p>
<p>of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their </p>
<p>inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but </p>
<p>whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as </p>
<p>marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham </p>
<p>immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of </p>
<p>the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly </p>
<p>what he represented. </p>
<p>When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance </p>
<p>and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost </p>
<p>have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and </p>
<p>so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness </p>
<p>between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her </p>
<p>features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke </p>
<p>very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose </p>
<p>appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was </p>
<p>entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a </p>
<p>screen in the proper direction before her eyes. </p>
<p>After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the </p>
<p>windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to </p>
<p>point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing </p>
<p>them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. </p>
<p>The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all </p>
<p>the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had </p>
<p>promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at </p>
<p>the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as </p>
<p>if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, </p>
<p>and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish </p>
<p>was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who </p>
<p>was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law </p>
<p>said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine </p>
<p>could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their </p>
<p>excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, </p>
<p>especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to </p>
<p>them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth </p>
<p>was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she </p>
<p>was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former </p>
<p>of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the </p>
<p>latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson </p>
<p>was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh </p>
<p>ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was </p>
<p>indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and </p>
<p>the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. </p>
<p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was </p>
<p>little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did </p>
<p>without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her </p>
<p>opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved </p>
<p>that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She </p>
<p>inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and </p>
<p>minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the </p>
<p>management of them all; told her how everything ought to be </p>
<p>regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to </p>
<p>the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that </p>
<p>nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could </p>
<p>furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the </p>
<p>intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a </p>
<p>variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to </p>
<p>the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who </p>
<p>she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind </p>
<p>of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she </p>
<p>had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether </p>
<p>any of them were likely to be married, whether they were </p>
<p>handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her </p>
<p>father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? </p>
<p>Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but </p>
<p>answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then </p>
<p>observed, </p>
<p>"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For </p>
<p>your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but </p>
<p>otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the </p>
<p>female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de </p>
<p>Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?" </p>
<p>"A little." </p>
<p>"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear </p>
<p>you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to--- </p>
<p>You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?" </p>
<p>"One of them does." </p>
<p>"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. </p>
<p>The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an </p>
<p>income as yours. Do you draw?" </p>
<p>"No, not at all." </p>
<p>"What, none of you?" </p>
<p>"Not one." </p>
<p>"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no </p>
<p>opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town </p>
<p>every spring for the benefit of masters." </p>
<p>"My mother would have had no objection, but my father </p>
<p>hates London." </p>
<p>"Has your governess left you?" </p>
<p>"We never had any governess." </p>
<p>"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters </p>
<p>brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of </p>
<p>such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to </p>
<p>your education." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that </p>
<p>had not been the case. </p>
<p>"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a </p>
<p>governess, you must have been neglected." </p>
<p>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but </p>
<p>such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We </p>
<p>were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that </p>
<p>were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might." </p>
<p>"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, </p>
<p>and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her </p>
<p>most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is </p>
<p>to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, </p>
<p>and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how </p>
<p>many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. </p>
<p>I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four </p>
<p>nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated </p>
<p>through my means; and it was but the other day that I </p>
<p>recommended another young person, who was merely </p>
<p>accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite </p>
<p>delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady </p>
<p>Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope </p>
<p>a treasure. 'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a </p>
<p>treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?" </p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, all." </p>
<p>"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only </p>
<p>the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are </p>
<p>married! Your younger sisters must be very young?" </p>
<p>"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps SHE is full </p>
<p>young to be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it </p>
<p>would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not </p>
<p>have their share of society and amusement, because the elder </p>
<p>may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The </p>
<p>last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the </p>
<p>first. And to be kept back on SUCH a motive! I think it would </p>
<p>not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of </p>
<p>mind." </p>
<p>"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your </p>
<p>opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is </p>
<p>your age?" </p>
<p>"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth, </p>
<p>smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it." </p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a </p>
<p>direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first </p>
<p>creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified </p>
<p>impertinence. </p>
<p>"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you </p>
<p>need not conceal your age." </p>
<p>"I am not one-and-twenty." </p>
<p>When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, </p>
<p>the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and </p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de </p>
<p>Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour </p>
<p>of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table </p>
<p>was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that </p>
<p>did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson </p>
<p>expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too </p>
<p>cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more </p>
<p>passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally </p>
<p>speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating </p>
<p>some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in </p>
<p>agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for </p>
<p>every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too </p>
<p>many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his </p>
<p>memory with anecdotes and noble names. </p>
<p>When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long </p>
<p>as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was </p>
<p>offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately </p>
<p>ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady </p>
<p>Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the </p>
<p>morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the </p>
<p>arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness </p>
<p>on Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they </p>
<p>departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth </p>
<p>was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she </p>
<p>had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made </p>
<p>more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, </p>
<p>though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy </p>
<p>Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her </p>
<p>ladyship's praise into his own hands. </p>

<heading>Chapter 30. </heading>
<p>Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit </p>
<p>was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most </p>
<p>comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and </p>
<p>such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir </p>
<p>William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to </p>
<p>driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but </p>
<p>when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual </p>
<p>employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did </p>
<p>not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of </p>
<p>the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him </p>
<p>either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and </p>
<p>looking out of the window in his own book-room, which </p>
<p>fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was </p>
<p>backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that </p>
<p>Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common </p>
<p>use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant </p>
<p>aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent </p>
<p>reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly </p>
<p>have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one </p>
<p>equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the </p>
<p>arrangement. </p>
<p>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in </p>
<p>the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge </p>
<p>of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss </p>
<p>de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed </p>
<p>coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every </p>
<p>day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a </p>
<p>few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely </p>
<p>ever prevailed upon to get out. </p>
<p>Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to </p>
<p>Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it </p>
<p>necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that </p>
<p>there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she </p>
<p>could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and </p>
<p>then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and </p>
<p>nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room </p>
<p>during these visits. She examined into their employments, </p>
<p>looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; </p>
<p>found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected </p>
<p>the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any </p>
<p>refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out </p>
<p>that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her </p>
<p>family. </p>
<p>Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was </p>
<p>not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most </p>
<p>active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of </p>
<p>which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any </p>
<p>of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, </p>
<p>discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to </p>
<p>settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold </p>
<p>them into harmony and plenty. </p>
<p>The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about </p>
<p>twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and </p>
<p>there being only one card-table in the evening, every such </p>
<p>entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other </p>
<p>engagements were few, as the style of living in the </p>
<p>neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. </p>
<p>This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole </p>
<p>she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours </p>
<p>of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was </p>
<p>so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment </p>
<p>out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently </p>
<p>went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was </p>
<p>along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where </p>
<p>there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value </p>
<p>but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady </p>
<p>Catherine's curiosity. </p>
<p>In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed </p>
<p>away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was </p>
<p>to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so </p>
<p>small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon </p>
<p>after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the </p>
<p>course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her </p>
<p>acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would </p>
<p>furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings </p>
<p>parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss </p>
<p>Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, </p>
<p>for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who </p>
<p>talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of </p>
<p>him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost </p>
<p>angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss </p>
<p>Lucas and herself. </p>
<p>His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. </p>
<p>Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the </p>
<p>lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the </p>
<p>earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the </p>
<p>carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great </p>
<p>intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to </p>
<p>Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady </p>
<p>Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with </p>
<p>him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord </p>
<p>----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. </p>
<p>Collins returned, the gentleman accompanied him. Charlotte </p>
<p>had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, </p>
<p>and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an </p>
<p>honour they might expect, adding: </p>
<p>"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me." </p>
<p>Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the </p>
<p>compliment, before their approach was announced by the </p>
<p>doorbell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered </p>
<p>the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about </p>
<p>thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the </p>
<p>gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look </p>
<p>in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual </p>
<p>reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings </p>
<p>toward her friend, met her with every appearance </p>
<p>of </p>
<p>composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying </p>
<p>a word. </p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with </p>
<p>the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very </p>
<p>pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight </p>
<p>observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for </p>
<p>some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, </p>
<p>his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth </p>
<p>after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual </p>
<p>way, and after a moment's pause, added: </p>
<p>"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. </p>
<p>Have you never happened to see her there?" </p>
<p>She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she </p>
<p>wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of </p>
<p>what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she </p>
<p>thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had </p>
<p>never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject </p>
<p>was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards </p>
<p>went away. </p>
<heading>Chapter 31. </heading>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at </p>
<p>the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add </p>
<p>considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. </p>
<p>It was some days, however, before they received any </p>
<p>invitation thither-for while there were visitors in the house, </p>
<p>they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, </p>
<p>almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were </p>
<p>honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely </p>
<p>asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the </p>
<p>last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her </p>
<p>daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage </p>
<p>more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen </p>
<p>only at church. </p>
<p>The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour </p>
<p>they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her </p>
<p>ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their </p>
<p>company was by no means so acceptable as when she could </p>
<p>get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her </p>
<p>nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more </p>
<p>than to any other person in the room. </p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; </p>
<p>anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. </p>
<p>Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very </p>
<p>much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably </p>
<p>of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, </p>
<p>of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so </p>
<p>well enter tained in that room before; and they conversed with </p>
<p>so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady </p>
<p>Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. HIS eyes had been </p>
<p>soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of </p>
<p>curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the </p>
<p>feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not </p>
<p>scruple to call out: </p>
<p>"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you </p>
<p>are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear </p>
<p>what it is." </p>
<p>"We are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no </p>
<p>longer able to avoid a reply. </p>
<p>"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my </p>
<p>delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are </p>
<p>speaking of music. There are few people in England, I </p>
<p>suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than </p>
<p>myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should </p>
<p>have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health </p>
<p>had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have </p>
<p>performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?" </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's </p>
<p>proficiency. </p>
<p>"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said </p>
<p>Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot </p>
<p>expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal." </p>
<p>"I assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need </p>
<p>such advice. She practises very constantly." </p>
<p>"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when </p>
<p>I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any </p>
<p>account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music </p>
<p>is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss </p>
<p>Bennet several times, that she will never play really well </p>
<p>unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no </p>
<p>instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to </p>
<p>come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. </p>
<p>Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, </p>
<p>in that part of the house." </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's </p>
<p>breeding, and made no answer. </p>
<p>ill- </p>
<p>When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded </p>
<p>Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down </p>
<p>directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady </p>
<p>Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to </p>
<p>her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and </p>
<p>making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte </p>
<p>stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair </p>
<p>performer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, </p>
<p>and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch </p>
<p>smile, and said: </p>
<p>"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all </p>
<p>this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister </p>
<p>DOES play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that </p>
<p>never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My </p>
<p>courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me." </p>
<p>"I shall not say you are mistaken," he replied, "because </p>
<p>you could not really believe me to entertain any design of </p>
<p>alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your </p>
<p>acquaintance long enough to know that you find great </p>
<p>enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact </p>
<p>are not your own." </p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and </p>
<p>said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very </p>
<p>pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. </p>
<p>I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to </p>
<p>expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had </p>
<p>hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that </p>
<p>you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me </p>
<p>leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to </p>
<p>retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your </p>
<p>relations to hear." </p>
<p>"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly. </p>
<p>"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried </p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves </p>
<p>among strangers." </p>
<p>"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something </p>
<p>very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in </p>
<p>Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, </p>
<p>what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, </p>
<p>though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, </p>
<p>more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a </p>
<p>partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact." </p>
<p>"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in </p>
<p>the assembly beyond my own party." </p>
<p>"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. </p>
<p>Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers </p>
<p>wait your orders." </p>
<p>"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I </p>
<p>sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend </p>
<p>myself to strangers." </p>
<p>"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said </p>
<p>Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask </p>
<p>him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in </p>
<p>the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?" </p>
<p>"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without </p>
<p>applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the </p>
<p>trouble." </p>
<p>"I certainly have not the talent which some people </p>
<p>possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have </p>
<p>never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or </p>
<p>appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done." </p>
<p>"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this </p>
<p>instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many </p>
<p>women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do </p>
<p>not produce the same expression. But then I have always </p>
<p>supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the </p>
<p>trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe MY fingers </p>
<p>as capable as any other woman's of superior execution." </p>
<p>Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have </p>
<p>employed your time much better. No one admitted to the </p>
<p>privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We </p>
<p>neither of us perform to strangers." </p>
<p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called </p>
<p>out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately </p>
<p>began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after </p>
<p>listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: </p>
<p>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised </p>
<p>more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She </p>
<p>has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not </p>
<p>equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful </p>
<p>performer, had her health allowed her to learn." </p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented </p>
<p>to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any </p>
<p>other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the </p>
<p>whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this </p>
<p>comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as </p>
<p>likely to marry HER, had she been his relation. </p>
<p>Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's </p>
<p>performance, mixing with them many instructions on </p>
<p>execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the </p>
<p>forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, </p>
<p>remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was </p>
<p>ready to take them all home. </p>

<heading>Chapter 32. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and </p>
<p>writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on </p>
<p>business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at </p>
<p>the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no </p>
<p>carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and </p>
<p>under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished </p>
<p>letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when </p>
<p>the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, </p>
<p>and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room. </p>
<p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and </p>
<p>apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had </p>
<p>understood all the ladies were to be within. </p>
<p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings </p>
<p>were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It </p>
<p>was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, </p>
<p>and in this emergence recollecting WHEN she had seen him </p>
<p>last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he </p>
<p>would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she </p>
<p>observed: </p>
<p>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last </p>
<p>November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable </p>
<p>surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if </p>
<p>I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters </p>
<p>were well, I hope, when you left London?" </p>
<p>"Perfectly so, I thank you." </p>
<p>She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, </p>
<p>after a short pause added: </p>
<p>"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much </p>
<p>idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?" </p>
<p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he </p>
<p>may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has </p>
<p>many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and </p>
<p>engagements are continually increasing." </p>
<p>"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be </p>
<p>better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place </p>
<p>entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. </p>
<p>But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for </p>
<p>the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we </p>
<p>must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle." </p>
<p>"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give </p>
<p>it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers." </p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking </p>
<p>longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now </p>
<p>determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him. </p>
<p>He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very </p>
<p>comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal </p>
<p>to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford." </p>
<p>"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have </p>
<p>bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object." </p>
<p>"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a </p>
<p>wife." </p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having </p>
<p>met with one of the very few sensible women who would </p>
<p>have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My </p>
<p>friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain </p>
<p>that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing </p>
<p>she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a </p>
<p>prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her." </p>
<p>"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so </p>
<p>easy a distance of her own family and friends." </p>
<p>"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles." </p>
<p>"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than </p>
<p>half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a VERY easy distance." </p>
<p>"I should never have considered the distance as one of the </p>
<p>ADVANTAGES of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should </p>
<p>never have said Mrs. Collins was settled NEAR her family." </p>
<p>"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. </p>
<p>Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I </p>
<p>suppose, would appear far." </p>
<p>As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth </p>
<p>fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be </p>
<p>thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she </p>
<p>answered: </p>
<p>"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too </p>
<p>near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and </p>
<p>depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is </p>
<p>fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, </p>
<p>distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case HERE. Mr. </p>
<p>and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a </p>
<p>one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded </p>
<p>my friend would not call herself NEAR her family under less </p>
<p>than HALF the present distance." </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, </p>
<p>"YOU cannot have a right to such very strong local </p>
<p>attachment. YOU cannot have been always at Longbourn." </p>
<p>Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced </p>
<p>some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a </p>
<p>newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a </p>
<p>colder voice: </p>
<p>"Are you pleased with Kent?" </p>
<p>A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on </p>
<p>either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the </p>
<p>entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her </p>
<p>walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the </p>
<p>mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, </p>
<p>and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to </p>
<p>anybody, went away. </p>
<p>"What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon </p>
<p>as he was gone. "My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, </p>
<p>or he would never have called us in this familiar way." </p>
<p>But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very </p>
<p>likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after </p>
<p>various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to </p>
<p>proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which </p>
<p>was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports </p>
<p>were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and </p>
<p>a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; </p>
<p>and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of </p>
<p>the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins </p>
<p>found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost </p>
<p>every day. They called at various times of the morning, </p>
<p>sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then </p>
<p>accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that </p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their </p>
<p>society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still </p>
<p>more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in </p>
<p>being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of </p>
<p>her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in </p>
<p>comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness </p>
<p>in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have </p>
<p>the best informed mind. </p>
<p>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was </p>
<p>more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he </p>
<p>frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his </p>
<p>lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity </p>
<p>rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to </p>
<p>himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins </p>
<p>knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's </p>
<p>occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was </p>
<p>generally different, which her own knowledge of him could </p>
<p>not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this </p>
<p>change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend </p>
<p>Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She </p>
<p>watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever </p>
<p>he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly </p>
<p>looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that </p>
<p>look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she </p>
<p>often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and </p>
<p>sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. She had </p>
<p>once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his </p>
<p>being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; </p>
<p>and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, </p>
<p>from the danger of raising expectations which might only end </p>
<p>in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a </p>
<p>doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could </p>
<p>suppose him to be in her power. </p>
<p>In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned </p>
<p>her marrying </p>
<p>Colonel </p>
<p>Fitzwilliam. He was beyond </p>
<p>comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, </p>
<p>and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to </p>
<p>counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable </p>
<p>patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all. </p>

<heading>Chapter 33 </heading>
<heading>More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, </heading>
<heading>unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of </heading>
<heading>the mischance that should bring him where no one else was </heading>
<heading>brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to </heading>
<heading>inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it </heading>
<heading>could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, </heading>
<heading>and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a </heading>
<heading>voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a </heading>
<heading>few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, </heading>
<heading>but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk </heading>
<heading>with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself </heading>
<heading>the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in </heading>
<heading>the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some </heading>
<p>odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at </p>
<p>Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. </p>
<p>and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings </p>
<p>and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to </p>
<p>expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be </p>
<p>staying THERE too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he </p>
<p>have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he </p>
<p>meant anything, he must mean and allusion to what might </p>
<p>arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite </p>
<p>glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the </p>
<p>Parsonage. </p>
<p>She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's </p>
<p>last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that </p>
<p>Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again </p>
<p>surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel </p>
<p>Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter </p>
<p>immediately and forcing a smile, she said: </p>
<p>"I did not know before that you ever walked this way." </p>
<p>"I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I </p>
<p>generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at </p>
<p>the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?" </p>
<p>"No, I should have turned in a moment." </p>
<p>And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the </p>
<p>Parsonage together. </p>
<p>"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she. </p>
<p>"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his </p>
<p>disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases." </p>
<p>"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he </p>
<p>has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not </p>
<p>know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing </p>
<p>what he likes than Mr. Darcy." </p>
<p>"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel </p>
<p>Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that he has better </p>
<p>means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and </p>
<p>many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you </p>
<p>know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence." </p>
<p>"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very </p>
<p>little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of </p>
<p>self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented </p>
<p>by want of money from going wherever you chose, or </p>
<p>procuring anything you had a fancy for?" </p>
<p>"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I </p>
<p>have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in </p>
<p>matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. </p>
<p>Younger sons cannot marry where they like." </p>
<p>"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think </p>
<p>they very often do." </p>
<p>"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there </p>
<p>are too many in my rank of life who can afford to marry </p>
<p>without some attention to money." </p>
<p>"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she </p>
<p>coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively </p>
<p>tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger </p>
<p>son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you </p>
<p>would not ask above fifty thousand pounds." </p>
<p>He answered her in the same style, and the subject </p>
<p>dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy </p>
<p>her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: </p>
<p>"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly </p>
<p>for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he </p>
<p>does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. </p>
<p>But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as </p>
<p>she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her." </p>
<p>"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage </p>
<p>which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the </p>
<p>guardian ship of Miss Darcy." </p>
<p>"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you </p>
<p>make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young </p>
<p>ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, </p>
<p>and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her </p>
<p>own way." </p>
<p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; </p>
<p>and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she </p>
<p>supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, </p>
<p>convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near </p>
<p>the truth. She directly replied: </p>
<p>"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of </p>
<p>her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in </p>
<p>the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of </p>
<p>my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have </p>
<p>heard you say that you know them." </p>
<p>"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant </p>
<p>gentlemanlike man--he is a great friend of Darcy's." </p>
<p>"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily; </p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy is </p>
<p>uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal </p>
<p>of care of him." </p>
<p>"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy DOES take care </p>
<p>of him in those points where he most wants care. From </p>
<p>something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason </p>
<p>to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to </p>
<p>beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley </p>
<p>was the person meant. It was all conjecture." </p>
<p>"What is it you mean?" </p>
<p>"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be </p>
<p>generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's </p>
<p>family, it would be an unpleasant thing." </p>
<p>"You may depend upon my not mentioning it." </p>
<p>"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing </p>
<p>it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he </p>
<p>congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the </p>
<p>inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without </p>
<p>mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only </p>
<p>suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of </p>
<p>young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing </p>
<p>them to have been together the whole of last summer." </p>
<p>"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?" </p>
<p>"I understood that there were some very strong objections </p>
<p>against the lady." </p>
<p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?" </p>
<p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam, </p>
<p>smiling. "He only told me what I have now told you." </p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart </p>
<p>swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, </p>
<p>Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful. </p>
<p>"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. </p>
<p>"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he </p>
<p>to be the judge?" </p>
<p>"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?" </p>
<p>"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the </p>
<p>propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own </p>
<p>judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what </p>
<p>manner his friend was to be happy. But," she continued, </p>
<p>recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is </p>
<p>not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there </p>
<p>was much affection in the case." </p>
<p>"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it </p>
<p>is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very </p>
<p>sadly." </p>
<p>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a </p>
<p>picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an </p>
<p>answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation </p>
<p>talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parson- </p>
<p>age. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor </p>
<p>left them, she could think without interruption of all that she </p>
<p>had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people </p>
<p>could be meant than those with whom she was connected. </p>
<p>There could not exist in the world TWO men over whom Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been </p>
<p>concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane </p>
<p>she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss </p>
<p>Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his </p>
<p>own vanity, however, did not mislead him, HE was the cause, </p>
<p>his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had </p>
<p>suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a </p>
<p>while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, </p>
<p>generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting </p>
<p>an evil he might have inflicted. </p>
<p>"There were some very strong objections against the lady," </p>
<p>were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections </p>
<p>probably were, her having one uncle who was a country </p>
<p>attorney, and another who was in business in London. </p>
<p>"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no </p>
<p>possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!- </p>
<p>-her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her </p>
<p>manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against </p>
<p>my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which </p>
<p>he will probably never each." When she thought of her </p>
<p>mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not </p>
<p>allow that any objections THERE had material weight with </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a </p>
<p>deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's </p>
<p>connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite </p>
<p>decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst </p>
<p>kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley </p>
<p>for his sister. </p>
<p>The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, </p>
<p>brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards </p>
<p>the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, </p>
<p>where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing </p>
<p>that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much </p>
<p>as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. </p>
<p>Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady </p>
<p>Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home. </p>

<heading>Chapter 34. </heading>
<p>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to </p>
<p>exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, </p>
<p>chose for her employment the examination of all the letters </p>
<p>which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They </p>
<p>contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of </p>
<p>past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. </p>
<p>But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want </p>
<p>of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her </p>
<p>style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at </p>
<p>ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had </p>
<p>been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence </p>
<p>conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it </p>
<p>had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful </p>
<p>boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a </p>
<p>keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation </p>
<p>to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after </p>
<p>the next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she </p>
<p>should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to </p>
<p>the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do. </p>
<p>She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without </p>
<p>remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel </p>
<p>Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, </p>
<p>and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy </p>
<p>about him. </p>
<p>While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the </p>
<p>sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by </p>
<p>the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had </p>
<p>once before called late in the evening, and might now come to </p>
<p>inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, </p>
<p>and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her </p>
<p>utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an </p>
<p>hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her </p>
<p>health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were </p>
<p>better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a </p>
<p>few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. </p>
<p>Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence </p>
<p>of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated </p>
<p>manner, and thus began: </p>
<p>"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will </p>
<p>not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently </p>
<p>I admire and love you." </p>
<p>Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She </p>
<p>stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered </p>
<p>sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, </p>
<p>and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke </p>
<p>well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be </p>
<p>detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of </p>
<p>tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of its </p>
<p>being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always </p>
<p>opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which </p>
<p>seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was </p>
<p>very unlikely to recommend his suit. </p>
<p>In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be </p>
<p>insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and </p>
<p>though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at </p>
<p>first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to </p>
<p>resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all </p>
<p>compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself </p>
<p>to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He </p>
<p>concluded with representing to her the strength of that </p>
<p>attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found </p>
<p>impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it </p>
<p>would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he </p>
<p>said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a </p>
<p>favourable answer. He SPOKE of apprehension and anxiety, </p>
<p>but his countenance expressed real security. Such a </p>
<p>circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he </p>
<p>ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said: </p>
<p>"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode </p>
<p>to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, </p>
<p>however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that </p>
<p>obligation should be felt, and if I could FEEL gratitude, I </p>
<p>would now thank you. But I cannot--I have never desired your </p>
<p>good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most </p>
<p>unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It </p>
<p>has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will </p>
<p>be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have </p>
<p>long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have </p>
<p>little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation." </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with </p>
<p>his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no </p>
<p>less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale </p>
<p>with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in </p>
<p>every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of </p>
<p>composure, and would not open his lips till he believed </p>
<p>himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's </p>
<p>feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, </p>
<p>he said: </p>
<p>"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of </p>
<p>expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so </p>
<p>little ENDEAVOUR at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of </p>
<p>small importance." </p>
<p>"I might as well inquire," replied she, "why with so evident </p>
<p>a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me </p>
<p>that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and </p>
<p>even against your character? Was not this some excuse for </p>
<p>incivility, if I WAS uncivil? But I have other provocations. </p>
<p>You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you- </p>
<p>had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, </p>
<p>do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept </p>
<p>the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, </p>
<p>the happiness of a most beloved sister?" </p>
<p>As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed </p>
<p>colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without </p>
<p>attempting to interrupt her while she continued: </p>
<p>"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No </p>
<p>motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted </p>
<p>THERE. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been </p>
<p>the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from </p>
<p>each other--of exposing one to the censure of the world for </p>
<p>caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for </p>
<p>disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the </p>
<p>acutest kind." </p>
<p>She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was </p>
<p>listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by </p>
<p>any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of </p>
<p>affected incredulity. </p>
<p>"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated. </p>
<p>With assumed tranquillity he then replied: "I have no wish </p>
<p>of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my </p>
<p>friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. </p>
<p>Towards HIM I have been kinder than towards myself." </p>
<p>Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil </p>
<p>reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to </p>
<p>conciliate her. </p>
<p>"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which </p>
<p>my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my </p>
<p>opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in </p>
<p>the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. </p>
<p>Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what </p>
<p>imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or </p>
<p>under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon </p>
<p>others?" </p>
<p>"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," </p>
<p>said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened </p>
<p>colour. </p>
<p>"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help </p>
<p>feeling an interest in him?" </p>
<p>"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, </p>
<p>his misfortunes have been great indeed." </p>
<p>"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. </p>
<p>"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty-- </p>
<p>comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages </p>
<p>which you must know to have been designed for him. You </p>
<p>have deprived the best years of his life of that independence </p>
<p>which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all </p>
<p>this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with </p>
<p>contempt and ridicule." </p>
<p>"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps </p>
<p>across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation </p>
<p>in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. </p>
<p>My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But </p>
<p>perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards </p>
<p>her, "these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your </p>
<p>pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that </p>
<p>had long prevented my forming any serious design. These </p>
<p>bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with </p>
<p>greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into </p>
<p>the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed </p>
<p>inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But </p>
<p>disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of </p>
<p>the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you </p>
<p>expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to </p>
<p>congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition </p>
<p>in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" </p>
<p>Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; </p>
<p>yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she </p>
<p>said: </p>
<p>"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the </p>
<p>mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than </p>
<p>as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing </p>
<p>you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner." </p>
<p>She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she </p>
<p>continued: </p>
<p>"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any </p>
<p>possible way that would have tempted me to accept it." </p>
<p>Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her </p>
<p>with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. </p>
<p>She went on: </p>
<p>"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may </p>
<p>almost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners, </p>
<p>impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your </p>
<p>conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, </p>
<p>were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on </p>
<p>which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; </p>
<p>and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were </p>
<p>the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on </p>
<p>to marry." </p>
<p>"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly </p>
<p>comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed </p>
<p>of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up </p>
<p>so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your </p>
<p>health and happiness." </p>
<p>And with these words he hastily left the room, and </p>
<p>Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and </p>
<p>quit the house. </p>
<p>The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She </p>
<p>knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness </p>
<p>sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she </p>
<p>reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review </p>
<p>of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many </p>
<p>months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all </p>
<p>the objections which had made him prevent his friend's </p>
<p>marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal </p>
<p>force in his own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying </p>
<p>to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his </p>
<p>pride, his abominable pride--his shameless avowal of what he </p>
<p>had done with respect to Jane--his unpardonable assurance in </p>
<p>acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the </p>
<p>unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, </p>
<p>his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon </p>
<p>overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment </p>
<p>had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated </p>
<p>reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made </p>
<p>her feel how unequal she was to encounter </p>
<p>Charlotte's </p>
<p>observation, and hurried her away to her room. </p>
<heading>Chapter 35. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts </p>
<p>and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She </p>
<p>could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; </p>
<p>it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally </p>
<p>indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, </p>
<p>to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding </p>
<p>directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of </p>
<p>entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther </p>
<p>from the turn-pike-road. The park paling was still the </p>
<p>boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates </p>
<p>into the ground. </p>
<p>After walking two or three times along that part of the </p>
<p>lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to </p>
<p>stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which </p>
<p>she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the </p>
<p>country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early </p>
<p>trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she </p>
<p>caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove </p>
<p>which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of </p>
<p>its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the </p>
<p>person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and </p>
<p>stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She </p>
<p>had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a </p>
<p>voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again </p>
<p>towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, </p>
<p>holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a </p>
<p>look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove </p>
<p>some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the </p>
<p>honour of reading that letter?" And then, with a slight bow, </p>
<p>turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight. </p>
<p>With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest </p>
<p>curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still </p>
<p>increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two </p>
<p>sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close </p>
<p>hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way </p>
<p>along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, </p>
<p>at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:- </p>
<p>"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the </p>
<p>apprehension of its containing any repetition of those </p>
<p>sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so </p>
<p>disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining </p>
<p>you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for </p>
<p>the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the </p>
<p>effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must </p>
<p>occasion, should have been spared, had not my character </p>
<p>required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon </p>
<p>the freedom with which I demand your attention; your </p>
<p>feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of </p>
<p>your justice. </p>
<p>"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means </p>
<p>of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first </p>
<p>mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I </p>
<p>had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that </p>
<p>I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and </p>
<p>humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the </p>
<p>prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have </p>
<p>thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged </p>
<p>favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any </p>
<p>other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been </p>
<p>brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to </p>
<p>which the separation of two young persons, whose affection </p>
<p>could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no </p>
<p>comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was </p>
<p>last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, </p>
<p>I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following </p>
<p>account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in </p>
<p>the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under </p>
<p>the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to </p>
<p>yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be </p>
<p>obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. </p>
<p>"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in </p>
<p>common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister </p>
<p>to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till </p>
<p>the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any </p>
<p>apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often </p>
<p>seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of </p>
<p>dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William </p>
<p>Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to </p>
<p>your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their </p>
<p>marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time </p>
<p>alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my </p>
<p>friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that </p>
<p>his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever </p>
<p>witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and </p>
<p>manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but </p>
<p>without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained </p>
<p>convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she </p>
<p>received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them </p>
<p>by any participation of sentiment. If YOU have not been </p>
<p>mistaken here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior </p>
<p>knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it </p>
<p>be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on </p>
<p>her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall </p>
<p>not scruple to assert, that the serenity </p>
<p>of your sister's </p>
<p>countenance and air was such as might have given the most </p>
<p>acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, </p>
<p>her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was </p>
<p>desirous of believing her indifferent is certain--but I will </p>
<p>venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not </p>
<p>usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her </p>
<p>to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial </p>
<p>conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to </p>
<p>the marriage were not merely those which I last night </p>
<p>acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put </p>
<p>aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so </p>
<p>great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other </p>
<p>causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and </p>
<p>existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself </p>
<p>endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately </p>
<p>before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The </p>
<p>situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was </p>
<p>nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so </p>
<p>frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your </p>
<p>three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. </p>
<p>Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your </p>
<p>concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your </p>
<p>displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you </p>
<p>consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so </p>
<p>as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less </p>
<p>generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is </p>
<p>honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only </p>
<p>say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of </p>
<p>all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened </p>
<p>which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from </p>
<p>what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left </p>
<p>Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am </p>
<p>certain, remember, with the design of soon returning. </p>
<p>"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' </p>
<p>uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our </p>
<p>coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike </p>
<p>sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, </p>
<p>we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We </p>
<p>accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of </p>
<p>pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I </p>
<p>described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this </p>
<p>remonstrance might have staggered or </p>
<p>delayed </p>
<p>his </p>
<p>determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have </p>
<p>prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the </p>
<p>assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's </p>
<p>indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection </p>
<p>with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great </p>
<p>natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my </p>
<p>judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that </p>
<p>he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To </p>
<p>persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that </p>
<p>conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a </p>
<p>moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. </p>
<p>There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on </p>
<p>which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I </p>
<p>condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal </p>
<p>from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it </p>
<p>was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet </p>
<p>ignorant of it. That they might </p>
<p>have met without ill </p>
<p>consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not </p>
<p>appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without </p>
<p>some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was </p>
<p>beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. </p>
<p>On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology </p>
<p>to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was </p>
<p>unknowingly done and though the motives which governed </p>
<p>me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not </p>
<p>yet learnt to condemn them. </p>
<p>"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of </p>
<p>having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying </p>
<p>before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of </p>
<p>what he has PARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant; but </p>
<p>of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one </p>
<p>witness of undoubted veracity. </p>
<p>"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who </p>
<p>had for many years the management of all the Pemberley </p>
<p>estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust </p>
<p>naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on </p>
<p>George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was </p>
<p>therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at </p>
<p>school, and </p>
<p>afterwards at Cambridge--most important </p>
<p>assistance, as his own father, always </p>
<p>poor </p>
<p>from </p>
<p>the </p>
<p>extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him </p>
<p>a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this </p>
<p>young man's society, whose manner were always engaging; he </p>
<p>had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church </p>
<p>would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As </p>
<p>for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think </p>
<p>of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities-- </p>
<p>the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the </p>
<p>knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation </p>
<p>of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who </p>
<p>had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again shall give you pain--to </p>
<p>what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the </p>
<p>sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of </p>
<p>their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real </p>
<p>character--it adds even another motive. </p>
<p>"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his </p>
<p>attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in </p>
<p>his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his </p>
<p>advancement in the best manner that his profession might al- </p>
<p>low--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family </p>
<p>living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was </p>
<p>also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not </p>
<p>long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally </p>
<p>resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it </p>
<p>unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate </p>
<p>pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he </p>
<p>could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of </p>
<p>studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one </p>
<p>thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. </p>
<p>I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any </p>
<p>rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was </p>
<p>therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance in </p>
<p>the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation </p>
<p>to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. </p>
<p>All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought </p>
<p>too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society </p>
<p>in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying </p>
<p>the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all </p>
<p>restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For </p>
<p>about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of </p>
<p>the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, </p>
<p>he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His </p>
<p>circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in </p>
<p>believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a </p>
<p>most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on </p>
<p>being ordained, if I would present him to the living in </p>
<p>question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he </p>
<p>was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and </p>
<p>I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You </p>
<p>will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this </p>
<p>entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment </p>
<p>was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he </p>
<p>was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his </p>
<p>reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of </p>
<p>acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last </p>
<p>summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. </p>
<p>"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish </p>
<p>to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present </p>
<p>should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said </p>
<p>thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is </p>
<p>more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of </p>
<p>my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About </p>
<p>a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment </p>
<p>formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the </p>
<p>lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to </p>
<p>have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. </p>
<p>Younge, </p>
<p>in </p>
<p>whose character we were most unhappily </p>
<p>deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far </p>
<p>recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart </p>
<p>retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, </p>
<p>that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to </p>
<p>consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must </p>
<p>be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to </p>
<p>add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them </p>
<p>unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and </p>
<p>then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and </p>
<p>offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, </p>
<p>acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt </p>
<p>and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings </p>
<p>prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, </p>
<p>who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of </p>
<p>course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object </p>
<p>was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty </p>
<p>thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of </p>
<p>revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His </p>
<p>revenge would have been complete indeed. </p>
<p>"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in </p>
<p>which we have been concerned together; and if you do not </p>
<p>absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me </p>
<p>henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in </p>
<p>what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed </p>
<p>on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. </p>
<p>Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning </p>
<p>either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion </p>
<p>certainly not in your inclination. </p>
<p>"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you </p>
<p>last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to </p>
<p>know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of </p>
<p>everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the </p>
<p>testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near </p>
<p>relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of </p>
<p>the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably </p>
<p>acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your </p>
<p>abhorrence of ME should make MY assertions valueless, you </p>
<p>cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my </p>
<p>cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting </p>
<p>him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this </p>
<p>letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only </p>
<p>add, God bless you. </p>
<p>"FITZWILLIAM DARCY" </p>
<heading>Chapter 36. </heading>
<p>If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not </p>
<p>expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no </p>
<p>expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may </p>
<p>well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and </p>
<p>what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she </p>
<p>read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she </p>
<p>first understand that he believed any apology to be in his </p>
<p>power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have </p>
<p>no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not </p>
<p>conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might </p>
<p>say, she began his account of what had happened at </p>
<p>Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her </p>
<p>power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing </p>
<p>what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of </p>
<p>attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of </p>
<p>her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and </p>
<p>his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, </p>
<p>made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He </p>
<p>expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; </p>
<p>his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and </p>
<p>insolence. </p>
<p>But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. </p>
<p>Wickham--when she read with somewhat clearer attention a </p>
<p>relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every </p>
<p>cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an </p>
<p>affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet </p>
<p>more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. </p>
<p>Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. </p>
<p>She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, </p>
<p>"This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest </p>
<p>falsehood!"-and when she had gone through the whole letter, </p>
<p>though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put </p>
<p>it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that </p>
<p>she would never look in it again. </p>
<p>In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could </p>
<p>rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a </p>
<p>minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as </p>
<p>well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of </p>
<p>all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as </p>
<p>to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his </p>
<p>connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he </p>
<p>had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, </p>
<p>though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally </p>
<p>well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the </p>
<p>other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. </p>
<p>What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her </p>
<p>memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible </p>
<p>not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the </p>
<p>other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her </p>
<p>wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the </p>
<p>closest attention, the particulars immediately following of </p>
<p>Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his </p>
<p>receiving in lieu so consider able a sum as three thousand </p>
<p>pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the </p>
<p>letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be </p>
<p>impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement-- </p>
<p>but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. </p>
<p>Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the </p>
<p>affair, which she had believed it impossible that any </p>
<p>contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's </p>
<p>conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which </p>
<p>must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole. </p>
<p>The extravagance and general profligacy which he </p>
<p>scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly </p>
<p>shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its </p>
<p>injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into </p>
<p>the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the </p>
<p>persuasion of the </p>
<p>young man who, on meeting him </p>
<p>accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. </p>
<p>Of his former way of life nothing had been known in </p>
<p>Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real </p>
<p>character, had information been in her power, she had never </p>
<p>felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner </p>
<p>had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. </p>
<p>She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some </p>
<p>distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might </p>
<p>rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the </p>
<p>predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under </p>
<p>which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had </p>
<p>described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. </p>
<p>But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him </p>
<p>instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she </p>
<p>could remember no more substantial good than the general </p>
<p>approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his </p>
<p>social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on </p>
<p>this point a considerable while, she once more continued to </p>
<p>read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on </p>
<p>Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had </p>
<p>passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the </p>
<p>morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of </p>
<p>every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom </p>
<p>she had previously received the information of his near </p>
<p>concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had </p>
<p>no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on </p>
<p>applying </p>
<p>to </p>
<p>him, but the idea was checked by the </p>
<p>awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly </p>
<p>banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have </p>
<p>hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of </p>
<p>his cousin's corroboration. </p>
<p>She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in </p>
<p>conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first </p>
<p>evening at Mr. Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still </p>
<p>fresh in her memory. She was NOW struck with the </p>
<p>impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and </p>
<p>wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of </p>
<p>putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency </p>
<p>of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he </p>
<p>had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy might leave the country, but that HE should stand his </p>
<p>ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next </p>
<p>week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family </p>
<p>had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but </p>
<p>herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere </p>
<p>discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect </p>
<p>for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. </p>
<p>How differently did everything now appear in which he </p>
<p>was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the </p>
<p>consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the </p>
<p>mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of </p>
<p>his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His </p>
<p>behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; </p>
<p>he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had </p>
<p>been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference </p>
<p>which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every </p>
<p>lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in </p>
<p>farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his </p>
<p>blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were </p>
<p>his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their </p>
<p>acquaintance-an acquaintance which had latterly brought them </p>
<p>much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways- </p>
<p>-seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust- </p>
<p>-anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that </p>
<p>among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that </p>
<p>even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that </p>
<p>she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as </p>
<p>to prove him capable of SOME amiable feeling; that had his </p>
<p>actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a </p>
<p>violation </p>
<p>of </p>
<p>everything </p>
<p>right could hardly have been </p>
<p>concealed from the world; and that friendship between a </p>
<p>person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, </p>
<p>was incomprehensible. </p>
<p>She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy </p>
<p>nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been </p>
<p>blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd. </p>
<p>"How despicably I have acted!" she cried; "I, who have </p>
<p>prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself </p>
<p>on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous </p>
<p>candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or </p>
<p>blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, </p>
<p>how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have </p>
<p>been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been </p>
<p>my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by </p>
<p>the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our </p>
<p>acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, </p>
<p>and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till </p>
<p>this moment I never knew myself." </p>
<p>From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts </p>
<p>were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy's explanation THERE had appeared very insufficient, </p>
<p>and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a </p>
<p>second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his </p>
<p>assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give </p>
<p>in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of </p>
<p>her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering </p>
<p>what Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she </p>
<p>deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's </p>
<p>feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there </p>
<p>was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often </p>
<p>united with great sensibility. </p>
<p>When she came to that part of the letter in which her </p>
<p>family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet </p>
<p>merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice </p>
<p>of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the </p>
<p>circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having </p>
<p>passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first </p>
<p>disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on </p>
<p>his mind than on hers. </p>
<p>The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It </p>
<p>soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which </p>
<p>had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as </p>
<p>she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the </p>
<p>work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the </p>
<p>credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, </p>
<p>she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known </p>
<p>before. </p>
<p>to every </p>
<p>After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way </p>
<p>variety of </p>
<p>thought--re-considering events, </p>
<p>determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as </p>
<p>she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, </p>
<p>and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length </p>
<p>return home; and she entered the house with the wish of </p>
<p>appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing </p>
<p>such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation. </p>
<p>She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from </p>
<p>Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only </p>
<p>for a few minutes, to take leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam </p>
<p>had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her </p>
<p>return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be </p>
<p>found. Elizabeth could but just AFFECT concern in missing </p>
<p>him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no </p>
<p>longer an object; she could think only of her letter. </p>

<heading>Chapter 37. </heading>
<p>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. </p>
<p>Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them </p>
<p>his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing </p>
<p>intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as </p>
<p>tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy </p>
<p>scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then </p>
<p>hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on </p>
<p>his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message </p>
<p>from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to </p>
<p>make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. </p>
<p>Elizabeth could </p>
<p>not </p>
<p>see Lady </p>
<p>Catherine without </p>
<p>recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time </p>
<p>have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she </p>
<p>think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation </p>
<p>would have been. "What would she have said? how would she </p>
<p>have behaved?" were questions with which she amused </p>
<p>herself. </p>
<p>Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. </p>
<p>"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I </p>
<p>believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I </p>
<p>am particularly attached to these young men, and know them </p>
<p>to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to </p>
<p>go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits </p>
<p>tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most </p>
<p>acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to </p>
<p>Rosings certainly increases." </p>
<p>Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in </p>
<p>here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and </p>
<p>daughter. </p>
<p>Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet </p>
<p>seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by </p>
<p>herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so </p>
<p>soon, she added: </p>
<p>"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and </p>
<p>beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very </p>
<p>glad of your company, I am sure." </p>
<p>"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind </p>
<p>invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to </p>
<p>accept it. I must be in town next Saturday." </p>
<p>"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. </p>
<p>I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so </p>
<p>before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so </p>
<p>soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another </p>
<p>fortnight." </p>
<p>"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my </p>
<p>return." </p>
<p>"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother </p>
<p>can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. </p>
<p>And if you will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in </p>
<p>my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going </p>
<p>there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object </p>
<p>to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of </p>
<p>you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I </p>
<p>should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you </p>
<p>large." </p>
<p>"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide </p>
<p>by our original plan." </p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed resigned. "Mrs. Collins, you must </p>
<p>send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, </p>
<p>and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling </p>
<p>post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive </p>
<p>to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to </p>
<p>that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly </p>
<p>guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. </p>
<p>When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I </p>
<p>made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. </p>
<p>Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and </p>
<p>Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a </p>
<p>different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those </p>
<p>things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. </p>
<p>Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would </p>
<p>really be discreditable to YOU to let them go alone." </p>
<p>"My uncle is to send a servant for us." </p>
<p>"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am </p>
<p>very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. </p>
<p>Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If </p>
<p>you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to." </p>
<p>Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting </p>
<p>their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, </p>
<p>attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky </p>
<p>for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten </p>
<p>where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; </p>
<p>whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest </p>
<p>relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which </p>
<p>she might indulge in </p>
<p>all the delight of unpleasant </p>
<p>recollections. </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing </p>
<p>by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards </p>
<p>its writer were at times widely different. When she </p>
<p>remembered the style of his address, she was still full of </p>
<p>indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had </p>
<p>condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against </p>
<p>herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of </p>
<p>compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general </p>
<p>character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could </p>
<p>she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest </p>
<p>inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, </p>
<p>there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the </p>
<p>unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier </p>
<p>chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented </p>
<p>with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain </p>
<p>the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, </p>
<p>with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible </p>
<p>of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an </p>
<p>endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; </p>
<p>but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, </p>
<p>what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, </p>
<p>weak-spirited, irritable, and completely </p>
<p>under Lydia's </p>
<p>guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and </p>
<p>Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a </p>
<p>hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was </p>
<p>an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while </p>
<p>Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be </p>
<p>going there forever. </p>
<p>Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; </p>
<p>and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her </p>
<p>former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had </p>
<p>lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his </p>
<p>conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the </p>
<p>implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous </p>
<p>then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every </p>
<p>respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for </p>
<p>happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and </p>
<p>indecorum of her own family! </p>
<p>When to these recollections was added the development of </p>
<p>Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy </p>
<p>spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so </p>
<p>much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to </p>
<p>appear tolerably cheerful. </p>
<p>Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the </p>
<p>last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last </p>
<p>evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired </p>
<p>minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them </p>
<p>directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent </p>
<p>on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that </p>
<p>Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the </p>
<p>work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh. </p>
<p>When they parted, </p>
<p>Lady Catherine, with great </p>
<p>condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them </p>
<p>to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh </p>
<p>exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to </p>
<p>both. </p>

<heading>Chapter 38. </heading>
<p>On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for </p>
<p>breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he </p>
<p>took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he </p>
<p>deemed indispensably necessary. </p>
<p>"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. </p>
<p>Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in </p>
<p>coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the </p>
<p>house without receiving her thanks for it. The favor of your </p>
<p>company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how </p>
<p>little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain </p>
<p>manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the </p>
<p>little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull </p>
<p>to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us </p>
<p>grateful for the condescension, and that we have done </p>
<p>everything in our power to prevent your spending your time </p>
<p>unpleasantly." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of </p>
<p>happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and </p>
<p>the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions </p>
<p>she had received, must make HER feel the obliged. Mr. </p>
<p>Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity </p>
<p>replied: </p>
<p>"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed </p>
<p>your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; </p>
<p>and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you </p>
<p>to very superior society, and, from our connection with </p>
<p>Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home </p>
<p>scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford </p>
<p>visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with </p>
<p>regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of </p>
<p>extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. </p>
<p>You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually </p>
<p>we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with </p>
<p>all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not </p>
<p>think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they </p>
<p>are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings." </p>
<p>Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; </p>
<p>and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth </p>
<p>tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences. </p>
<p>"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into </p>
<p>Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you </p>
<p>will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. </p>
<p>Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust </p>
<p>it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate- </p>
<p>but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me </p>
<p>assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart </p>
<p>most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear </p>
<p>Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. </p>
<p>There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of </p>
<p>character and ideas between us. We seem to have been </p>
<p>designed for each other." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness </p>
<p>where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, </p>
<p>that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. </p>
<p>She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them </p>
<p>interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor </p>
<p>Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But </p>
<p>she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently </p>
<p>regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask </p>
<p>for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish </p>
<p>and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet </p>
<p>lost their charms. </p>
<p>At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, </p>
<p>the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. </p>
<p>After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth </p>
<p>was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they </p>
<p>walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his </p>
<p>best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the </p>
<p>kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his </p>
<p>compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He </p>
<p>then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the </p>
<p>point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with </p>
<p>some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave </p>
<p>any message for the ladies at Rosings. </p>
<p>"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your </p>
<p>humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks </p>
<p>for their kindness to you while you have been here." </p>
<p>Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to </p>
<p>be shut, and the carriage drove off. </p>
<p>"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, </p>
<p>"it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet h ow </p>
<p>many things have happened!" </p>
<p>"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh. </p>
<p>"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea </p>
<p>there twice! How much I shall have to tell!" Elizabeth added </p>
<p>privately, "And how much I shall have to conceal!" </p>
<p>Their journey was performed without much conversation, </p>
<p>or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford </p>
<p>they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain </p>
<p>a few days. </p>
<p>Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of </p>
<p>studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which </p>
<p>the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was </p>
<p>to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure </p>
<p>enough for observation. </p>
<p>It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could </p>
<p>wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of </p>
<p>revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, </p>
<p>at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity </p>
<p>she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a </p>
<p>temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but </p>
<p>the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent </p>
<p>of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once </p>
<p>entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating </p>
<p>something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister </p>
<p>further. </p>

<heading>Chapter 39. </heading>
<p>It was the second week in May, in which the three young </p>
<p>ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town </p>
<p>of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed </p>
<p>inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they </p>
<p>quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, </p>
<p>both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs. </p>
<p>These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily </p>
<p>employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the </p>
<p>sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber. </p>
<p>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed </p>
<p>a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually </p>
<p>affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable </p>
<p>surprise?" </p>
<p>"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, "but you </p>
<p>must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the </p>
<p>shop out there." Then, showing her purchases--"Look here, I </p>
<p>have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I </p>
<p>thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as </p>
<p>soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better." </p>
<p>And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with </p>
<p>perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much </p>
<p>uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier- </p>
<p>coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very </p>
<p>tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears </p>
<p>this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are </p>
<p>going in a fortnight." </p>
<p>"Are they indeed!" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest </p>
<p>satisfaction. </p>
<p>"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so </p>
<p>want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be </p>
<p>such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost </p>
<p>anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! </p>
<p>Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!" </p>
<p>"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "THAT would be a delightful </p>
<p>scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good </p>
<p>Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, </p>
<p>who have been overset already by one poor regiment of </p>
<p>militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!" </p>
<p>"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they </p>
<p>sat down at table. "What do you think? It is excellent news- </p>
<p>capital news--and about a certain person we all like!" </p>
<p>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter </p>
<p>was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said: </p>
<p>"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You </p>
<p>thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he </p>
<p>often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is </p>
<p>an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long </p>
<p>chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear </p>
<p>Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no </p>
<p>danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! </p>
<p>She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. </p>
<p>Wickham is safe." </p>
<p>"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a </p>
<p>connection imprudent as to fortune." </p>
<p>"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him." </p>
<p>"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," </p>
<p>said Jane. </p>
<p>"I am sure there is not on HIS. I will answer for it, he </p>
<p>never cared three straws about her--who could about such a </p>
<p>nasty little freckled thing?" </p>
<p>Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of </p>
<p>such coarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of </p>
<p>the SENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had </p>
<p>harboured and fancied liberal! </p>
<p>As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage </p>
<p>was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, </p>
<p>with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the </p>
<p>unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were </p>
<p>seated in it. </p>
<p>"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. "I am </p>
<p>glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having </p>
<p>another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and </p>
<p>snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first </p>
<p>place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went </p>
<p>away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any </p>
<p>flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a </p>
<p>husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid </p>
<p>soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how </p>
<p>ashamed I should be of not being married before three- </p>
<p>andtwenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, </p>
<p>you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. </p>
<p>Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in </p>
<p>it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; </p>
<p>and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! </p>
<p>we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel </p>
<p>Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. </p>
<p>Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the </p>
<p>bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she </p>
<p>asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so </p>
<p>Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you </p>
<p>think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's </p>
<p>clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not </p>
<p>a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and </p>
<p>me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her </p>
<p>gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When </p>
<p>Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the </p>
<p>men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I </p>
<p>laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have </p>
<p>died. And THAT made the men suspect something, and then </p>
<p>they soon found out what was the matter." </p>
<p>With such kinds of histories of their parties and good </p>
<p>jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, </p>
<p>endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to </p>
<p>Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there </p>
<p>was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name. </p>
<p>Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than </p>
<p>once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to </p>
<p>Elizabeth: </p>
<p>"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy." </p>
<p>Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the </p>
<p>Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various </p>
<p>were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was </p>
<p>inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest </p>
<p>daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand </p>
<p>collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who </p>
<p>sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all </p>
<p>to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder </p>
<p>than any other person's, was enumerating the various </p>
<p>pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her. </p>
<p>"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we </p>
<p>had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the </p>
<p>blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I </p>
<p>should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; </p>
<p>and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very </p>
<p>handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold </p>
<p>luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would </p>
<p>have treated you too. And then when we came away it was </p>
<p>such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I </p>
<p>was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all </p>
<p>the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody </p>
<p>might have heard us ten miles off!" </p>
<p>To this Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my </p>
<p>dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would </p>
<p>doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. </p>
<p>But I confess they would have no charms for ME--I should </p>
<p>infinitely prefer a book." </p>
<p>But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom </p>
<p>listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never </p>
<p>attended to Mary at all. </p>
<p>In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls </p>
<p>to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but </p>
<p>Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said </p>
<p>that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before </p>
<p>they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason </p>
<p>too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham </p>
<p>again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The </p>
<p>comfort to HER of the regiment's approaching removal was </p>
<p>indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and </p>
<p>once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague </p>
<p>her on his account. </p>
<p>She had not been many hours at home before she found </p>
<p>that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a </p>
<p>hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her </p>
<p>parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the </p>
<p>smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the </p>
<p>same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though </p>
<p>often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at </p>
<p>last. </p>

<p>Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had </p>
<p>happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, </p>
<p>resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was </p>
<p>concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to </p>
<p>her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy and herself. </p>
<p>Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the </p>
<p>strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of </p>
<p>Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly </p>
<p>lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should </p>
<p>have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to </p>
<p>recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the </p>
<p>unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him. </p>
<p>"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, </p>
<p>"and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how </p>
<p>much it must increase his disappointment!" </p>
<p>"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; </p>
<p>but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive </p>
<p>away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for </p>
<p>refusing him?" </p>
<p>"Blame you! Oh, no." </p>
<p>"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of </p>
<p>Wickham?" </p>
<p>"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what </p>
<p>you did." </p>
<p>"But you WILL know it, when I tell you what happened </p>
<p>the very next day." </p>
<p>She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its con </p>
<p>tents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a </p>
<p>stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone </p>
<p>through the world without believing that so much wickedness </p>
<p>existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in </p>
<p>one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful </p>
<p>to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. </p>
<p>Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, </p>
<p>and seek to clear the one without involving the other. </p>
<p>"This will not do," said Elizabeth; "you never will be able </p>
<p>to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, </p>
<p>but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a </p>
<p>quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one </p>
<p>good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty </p>
<p>much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but </p>
<p>you shall do as you choose." </p>
<p>It was some time, however, before a smile could be </p>
<p>extorted from Jane. </p>
<p>"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. </p>
<p>"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. </p>
<p>Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill </p>
<p>opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It </p>
<p>is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so." </p>
<p>"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by </p>
<p>seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample </p>
<p>justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned </p>
<p>and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you </p>
<p>lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a </p>
<p>feather." </p>
<p>"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness </p>
<p>in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his </p>
<p>manner!" </p>
<p>"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the </p>
<p>education of those two young men. One has got all the </p>
<p>goodness, and the other all the appearance of it." </p>
<p>"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the </p>
<p>APPEARANCE of it as you used to do." </p>
<p>"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so </p>
<p>decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur </p>
<p>to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of </p>
<p>that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying </p>
<p>anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man </p>
<p>without now and then stumbling on something witty." </p>
<p>"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could </p>
<p>not treat the matter as you do now." </p>
<p>"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may </p>
<p>say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, </p>
<p>no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very </p>
<p>weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I </p>
<p>wanted you!" </p>
<p>"How unfortunate that you should have used such v ery </p>
<p>strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for </p>
<p>now they DO appear wholly undeserved." </p>
<p>"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness </p>
<p>is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been </p>
<p>encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. </p>
<p>I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our </p>
<p>acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character." </p>
<p>Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there </p>
<p>can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is </p>
<p>your opinion?" </p>
<p>"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not </p>
<p>authorised me to make his communication public. On the </p>
<p>contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be </p>
<p>kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to </p>
<p>undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will </p>
<p>believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so </p>
<p>violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in </p>
<p>Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not </p>
<p>equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will </p>
<p>not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence </p>
<p>it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their </p>
<p>stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say </p>
<p>nothing about it." </p>
<p>"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might </p>
<p>ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has </p>
<p>done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not </p>
<p>make him desperate." </p>
<p>The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this </p>
<p>conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had </p>
<p>weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing </p>
<p>listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of </p>
<p>either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which </p>
<p>prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other </p>
<p>half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how </p>
<p>sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was </p>
<p>knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was </p>
<p>sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding </p>
<p>between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last </p>
<p>encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very </p>
<p>improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be </p>
<p>able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable </p>
<p>manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be </p>
<p>mine till it has lost all its value!" </p>
<p>She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to </p>
<p>observe the real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not </p>
<p>happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. </p>
<p>Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard </p>
<p>had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and </p>
<p>disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments </p>
<p>often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, </p>
<p>and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and </p>
<p>all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to </p>
<p>check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been </p>
<p>injurious to her own health and their tranquillity. </p>
<p>"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your </p>
<p>opinion NOW of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I </p>
<p>am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told </p>
<p>my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that </p>
<p>Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very </p>
<p>undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least </p>
<p>chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no </p>
<p>talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I </p>
<p>have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know." </p>
<p>"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any </p>
<p>more." </p>
<p>"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to </p>
<p>come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter </p>
<p>extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. </p>
<p>Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; </p>
<p>and then he will be sorry for what he has done." </p>
<p>But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such </p>
<p>expectation, she made no answer. </p>
<p>"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother, soon afterwards, </p>
<p>"and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, </p>
<p>well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they </p>
<p>keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is </p>
<p>half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is </p>
<p>nothing extravagant in THEIR housekeeping, I dare say." </p>
<p>"No, nothing at all." </p>
<p>"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, </p>
<p>yes. THEY will take care not to outrun their income. THEY </p>
<p>will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it </p>
<p>do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having </p>
<p>Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as </p>
<p>quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens." </p>
<p>"It was a subject which they could not mention before me." </p>
<p>"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no </p>
<p>doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they </p>
<p>can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so </p>
<p>much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was </p>
<p>only entailed on me." </p>

<heading>Chapter 41. </heading>
<p>The first week of their return was soon gone. The second </p>
<p>began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and </p>
<p>all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping </p>
<p>apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss </p>
<p>Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and </p>
<p>pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently </p>
<p>were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, </p>
<p>whose own misery was extreme, and who could </p>
<p>not </p>
<p>comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family. </p>
<p>"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to </p>
<p>do?" would they often exclaiming the bitterness of woe. "How </p>
<p>can you be smiling so, Lizzy?" </p>
<p>Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she </p>
<p>remembered what she had herself endured on a similar </p>
<p>occasion, five and-twenty years ago. </p>
<p>"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when </p>
<p>Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have </p>
<p>broken my heart." </p>
<p>"I am sure I shall break MINE," said Lydia. </p>
<p>"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet. </p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so </p>
<p>disagreeable." </p>
<p>"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever." </p>
<p>"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal </p>
<p>of good," added Kitty. </p>
<p>Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually </p>
<p>through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by </p>
<p>them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt </p>
<p>anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she </p>
<p>been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views </p>
<p>of his friend. </p>
<p>But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared </p>
<p>away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the </p>
<p>wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to </p>
<p>Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, </p>
<p>and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and </p>
<p>good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, </p>
<p>and out of their THREE months' acquaintance they had been </p>
<p>intimate TWO. </p>
<p>The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of </p>
<p>Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification </p>
<p>of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to </p>
<p>her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless </p>
<p>ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing </p>
<p>and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless </p>
<p>Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as </p>
<p>unreasonable as her accent was peevish. </p>
<p>"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well </p>
<p>as Lydia," said she, "Though I am NOT her particular friend. I </p>
<p>have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, </p>
<p>for I am two years older." </p>
<p>In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and </p>
<p>Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this </p>
<p>invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as </p>
<p>in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death </p>
<p>warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and </p>
<p>detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she </p>
<p>could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. </p>
<p>She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general </p>
<p>behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the </p>
<p>friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the </p>
<p>probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a </p>
<p>companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater </p>
<p>than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said: </p>
<p>"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in </p>
<p>some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do </p>
<p>it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as </p>
<p>under the present circumstances." </p>
<p>"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great </p>
<p>disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice </p>
<p>of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner--nay, which has </p>
<p>already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently </p>
<p>in the affair." </p>
<p>"Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she </p>
<p>frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But </p>
<p>do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to </p>
<p>be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. </p>
<p>Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept </p>
<p>aloof by Lydia's folly." </p>
<p>"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. </p>
<p>It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now </p>
<p>complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world </p>
<p>must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and </p>
<p>disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse </p>
<p>me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not </p>
<p>take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of </p>
<p>teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the </p>
<p>business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of </p>
<p>amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at </p>
<p>sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or </p>
<p>her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest </p>
<p>degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a </p>
<p>tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her </p>
<p>mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal </p>
<p>contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this </p>
<p>danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever </p>
<p>Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! </p>
<p>Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will </p>
<p>not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and </p>
<p>that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?" </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, </p>
<p>and affectionately taking her hand said in reply: </p>
<p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you </p>
<p>and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and </p>
<p>you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of-- </p>
<p>or I may say, three--very silly sisters. We shall have no peace </p>
<p>at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, </p>
<p>then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out </p>
<p>of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an </p>
<p>object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less </p>
<p>importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. </p>
<p>The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us </p>
<p>hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own </p>
<p>insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees </p>
<p>worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her </p>
<p>life." </p>
<p>With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but </p>
<p>her own opinion continued the same, and she left him </p>
<p>disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to </p>
<p>increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was </p>
<p>confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over </p>
<p>unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of </p>
<p>her disposition. </p>
<p>Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her </p>
<p>conference with her father, their indignation would hardly </p>
<p>have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's </p>
<p>imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of </p>
<p>earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the </p>
<p>streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She </p>
<p>saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of </p>
<p>them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp- </p>
<p>-its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, </p>
<p>crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with </p>
<p>scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated </p>
<p>beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at </p>
<p>once. </p>
<p>Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such </p>
<p>prospects and such realities as these, what would have been </p>
<p>her sensations? They could have been understood only by her </p>
<p>mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to </p>
<p>Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy </p>
<p>conviction of her husband's never intending to go there </p>
<p>himself. </p>
<p>But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and </p>
<p>their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very </p>
<p>day of Lydia's leaving home. </p>
<p>Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. </p>
<p>Having been frequently in company with him since her return, </p>
<p>agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal </p>
<p>partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very </p>
<p>gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a </p>
<p>sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to </p>
<p>herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for </p>
<p>the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions </p>
<p>which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could </p>
<p>only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She </p>
<p>lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the </p>
<p>object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she </p>
<p>steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained </p>
<p>in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, </p>
<p>his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be </p>
<p>gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their </p>
<p>renewal. </p>
<p>On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at </p>
<p>Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; </p>
<p>and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good </p>
<p>humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in </p>
<p>which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned </p>
<p>Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three </p>
<p>weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with </p>
<p>the former. </p>
<p>He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a </p>
<p>moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he </p>
<p>had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was </p>
<p>a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. </p>
<p>Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of </p>
<p>indifference he soon afterwards added: </p>
<p>"How long did you say he was at Rosings?" </p>
<p>"Nearly three weeks." </p>
<p>"And you saw him frequently?" </p>
<p>"Yes, almost every day." </p>
<p>"His manners are very different from his cousin's." </p>
<p>"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon </p>
<p>acquaintance." </p>
<p>"Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not </p>
<p>escape her. "And pray, may I ask?--" But checking himself, he </p>
<p>added, in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has </p>
<p>he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?--for I </p>
<p>dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, </p>
<p>"that he is improved in essentials." </p>
<p>"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is </p>
<p>very much what he ever was." </p>
<p>While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing </p>
<p>whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. </p>
<p>There was a something in her countenance which made him </p>
<p>listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she </p>
<p>added: </p>
<p>"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not </p>
<p>mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of </p>
<p>improvement, but </p>
<p>that, </p>
<p>from knowing him better, his </p>
<p>disposition was better understood." </p>
<p>Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened </p>
<p>complexion and agitated look; for a few minute he was silent, </p>
<p>till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and </p>
<p>said in the gentlest of accents: </p>
<p>"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, </p>
<p>will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he </p>
<p>is wise enough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is </p>
<p>right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to </p>
<p>himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such </p>
<p>foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort </p>
<p>of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, </p>
<p>is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good </p>
<p>opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her </p>
<p>has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a </p>
<p>good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the </p>
<p>match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very </p>
<p>much at heart." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she </p>
<p>answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that </p>
<p>he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, </p>
<p>and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the </p>
<p>evening passed with the APPEARANCE, on his side, of usual </p>
<p>cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish </p>
<p>Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and </p>
<p>possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again. </p>
<p>When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster </p>
<p>to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next </p>
<p>morning. The separation between her and her family was </p>
<p>rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed </p>
<p>tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, </p>
<p>and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the </p>
<p>opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice </p>
<p>which there was every reason to believe would be well </p>
<p>attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself </p>
<p>in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were </p>
<p>uttered without being heard. </p>
<heading>Chapter 42. </heading>
<p>Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own </p>
<p>family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of </p>
<p>conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated </p>
<p>by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour </p>
<p>which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman </p>
<p>whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early </p>
<p>in their marriage put and end to all real affection for her. </p>
<p>Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and </p>
<p>all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. </p>
<p>Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the </p>
<p>disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in </p>
<p>any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate </p>
<p>for their folly of their vice. He was fond of the country and of </p>
<p>books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal </p>
<p>enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, </p>
<p>than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his </p>
<p>amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man </p>
<p>would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other </p>
<p>powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will </p>
<p>derive benefit from such as are given. </p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to </p>
<p>the </p>
<p>impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband. She had </p>
<p>always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and </p>
<p>grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she </p>
<p>endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to </p>
<p>banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal </p>
<p>obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the </p>
<p>contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. </p>
<p>But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages </p>
<p>which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, </p>
<p>nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill- </p>
<p>judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, </p>
<p>might at least have preserved the respectability of his </p>
<p>daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife. </p>
<p>When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure </p>
<p>she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the </p>
<p>regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, </p>
<p>and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant </p>
<p>repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a </p>
<p>real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might </p>
<p>in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers </p>
<p>of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose </p>
<p>disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to </p>
<p>be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of </p>
<p>such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the </p>
<p>whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes been </p>
<p>found before, that an event to which she had been looking </p>
<p>with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the </p>
<p>satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently </p>
<p>necessary to name some other period for the commencement </p>
<p>of actual felicity-to have some other point on which her </p>
<p>wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the </p>
<p>pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and </p>
<p>prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was </p>
<p>now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best </p>
<p>consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the </p>
<p>discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and </p>
<p>could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it </p>
<p>would have been perfect. </p>
<p>"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to </p>
<p>wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my </p>
<p>disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with </p>
<p>me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I </p>
<p>may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure </p>
<p>realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can </p>
<p>never be successful; and general disappointment is only </p>
<p>warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation." </p>
<p>When Lydia went away she promised to write very often </p>
<p>and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters </p>
<p>were always long expected, and always very short. Those to </p>
<p>her mother contained little else than that they were just </p>
<p>returned from the library, where such and such officers had </p>
<p>attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful </p>
<p>ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, </p>
<p>or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, </p>
<p>but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster </p>
<p>called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her </p>
<p>correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be </p>
<p>learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were </p>
<p>much too full of lines under the words to be made public. </p>
<p>After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, </p>
<p>health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at </p>
<p>Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families </p>
<p>who had been in town for the winter came back again, and </p>
<p>summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the </p>
<p>middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to </p>
<p>enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise </p>
<p>as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she </p>
<p>might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer </p>
<p>above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious </p>
<p>arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be </p>
<p>quartered in Meryton. </p>
<p>The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was </p>
<p>now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, </p>
<p>when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once </p>
<p>delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. </p>
<p>Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till </p>
<p>a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a </p>
<p>month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, </p>
<p>and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with </p>
<p>the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to </p>
<p>give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, </p>
<p>according to the present plan, were to go no farther north </p>
<p>wards than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be </p>
<p>seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. </p>
<p>Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where </p>
<p>she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where </p>
<p>they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an </p>
<p>object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of </p>
<p>Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak. </p>
<p>Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her </p>
<p>heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have </p>
<p>been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied--and </p>
<p>certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again. </p>
<p>With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas </p>
<p>connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without </p>
<p>thinking of Pemberley and its owner. "But surely," said she, "I </p>
<p>may enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few </p>
<p>petrified spars without his perceiving me." </p>
<p>The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks </p>
<p>were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But </p>
<p>they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their </p>
<p>four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The </p>
<p>children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger </p>
<p>boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin </p>
<p>Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense </p>
<p>and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to </p>
<p>them in every way-teaching them, playing with them, and </p>
<p>loving them. </p>
<p>The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set </p>
<p>off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and </p>
<p>amusement. One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness </p>
<p>of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health </p>
<p>and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance </p>
<p>every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might </p>
<p>supply it among themselves if there were disappointments </p>
<p>abroad. </p>
<p>It is not the object of this work to give a description of </p>
<p>Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through </p>
<p>which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, </p>
<p>Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small </p>
<p>part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town </p>
<p>of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, </p>
<p>and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still </p>
<p>remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the </p>
<p>principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of </p>
<p>Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was </p>
<p>situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile </p>
<p>or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. </p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was </p>
<p>applied to for her approbation. </p>
<p>"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you </p>
<p>have heard so much?" said her aunt; "a place, too, with which </p>
<p>so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham </p>
<p>passed all his youth there, you know." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business </p>
<p>at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for </p>
<p>seeing it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great </p>
<p>houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure </p>
<p>in fine carpets or satin curtains. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a </p>
<p>fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about </p>
<p>it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of </p>
<p>the finest woods in the country." </p>
<p>Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. </p>
<p>The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the </p>
<p>place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at </p>
<p>the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly </p>
<p>to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were </p>
<p>objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last </p>
<p>resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family </p>
<p>were unfavourably answered. </p>
<p>Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the </p>
<p>chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? </p>
<p>what was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, </p>
<p>whether the family were down for the summer? A most </p>
<p>welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms </p>
<p>now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of </p>
<p>curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was </p>
<p>revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could </p>
<p>readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she </p>
<p>had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, </p>
<p>therefore, they were to go. </p>

<heading>Chapter 43. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first </p>
<p>appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and </p>
<p>when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a </p>
<p>high flutter. </p>
<p>The park was very large, and contained great variety of </p>
<p>ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove </p>
<p>for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide </p>
<p>extent. </p>
<p>Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw </p>
<p>and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They </p>
<p>gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves </p>
<p>at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, </p>
<p>and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, </p>
<p>situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road </p>
<p>with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone </p>
<p>building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a </p>
<p>ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some </p>
<p>natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any </p>
<p>artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely </p>
<p>adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place </p>
<p>for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had </p>
<p>been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all </p>
<p>of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt </p>
<p>that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! </p>
<p>They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to </p>
<p>the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, </p>
<p>all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She </p>
<p>dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On </p>
<p>applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and </p>
<p>Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to </p>
<p>wonder at her being where she was. </p>
<p>The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly </p>
<p>woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any </p>
<p>notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining- </p>
<p>parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely </p>
<p>fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a </p>
<p>window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, </p>
<p>which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness </p>
<p>from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of </p>
<p>the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the </p>
<p>river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the </p>
<p>valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they </p>
<p>passed into other rooms these objects were taking different </p>
<p>positions; but from every window there were beauties to be </p>
<p>seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture </p>
<p>suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, </p>
<p>with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor </p>
<p>uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, </p>
<p>than the furniture of Rosings. </p>
<p>"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been </p>
<p>mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly </p>
<p>acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might </p>
<p>have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as </p>
<p>visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,"--recollecting herself-- </p>
<p>"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost </p>
<p>to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them." </p>
<p>This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something </p>
<p>very like regret. </p>
<p>She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her </p>
<p>master was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At </p>
<p>length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she </p>
<p>turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he </p>
<p>was, adding, "But we expect him to-morrow, with a large </p>
<p>party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own </p>
<p>journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day! </p>
<p>Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She </p>
<p>approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, </p>
<p>amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her </p>
<p>aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper </p>
<p>came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young </p>
<p>gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been </p>
<p>brought up by him at his own expense. "He is now gone into </p>
<p>the army," she added; "but I am afraid he has turned out very </p>
<p>wild." </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not return it. </p>
<p>"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the </p>
<p>miniatures, "is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at </p>
<p>the same time as the other--about eight years ago." </p>
<p>"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. </p>
<p>But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not." </p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on </p>
<p>this intimation of her knowing her master. </p>
<p>"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?" </p>
<p>Elizabeth coloured, and said: "A little." </p>
<p>"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, </p>
<p>ma'am?" </p>
<p>"Yes, very handsome." </p>
<p>"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery </p>
<p>upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. </p>
<p>This room was my late master's favourite room, and these </p>
<p>miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond </p>
<p>of them." </p>
<p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being </p>
<p>among them. </p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss </p>
<p>Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old. </p>
<p>"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner. </p>
<p>"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; </p>
<p>and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the </p>
<p>next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a </p>
<p>present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with </p>
<p>him." </p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, </p>
<p>encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and </p>
<p>remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had </p>
<p>evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. </p>
<p>"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the </p>
<p>year?" </p>
<p>"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may </p>
<p>spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for </p>
<p>the summer months." </p>
<p>"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to </p>
<p>Ramsgate." </p>
<p>"If your master would marry, you might see more of him." </p>
<p>"Yes, sir; but I do not know when THAT will be. I do not </p>
<p>know who is good enough for him." </p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help </p>
<p>saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you </p>
<p>should think so." </p>
<p>"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that </p>
<p>knows him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was </p>
<p>going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment </p>
<p>as the housekeeper added, "I have never known a cross word </p>
<p>from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was </p>
<p>four years old." </p>
<p>This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most </p>
<p>opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man </p>
<p>had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was </p>
<p>awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her </p>
<p>uncle for saying: </p>
<p>"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. </p>
<p>You are lucky in having such a master." </p>
<p>"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I </p>
<p>could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that </p>
<p>they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured </p>
<p>when they grow up; and he was always </p>
<p>the </p>
<p>sweetest- </p>
<p>tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world." </p>
<p>Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy?" </p>
<p>thought she. </p>
<p>"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner. </p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just </p>
<p>like him--just as affable to the poor." </p>
<p>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient </p>
<p>for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other </p>
<p>point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the </p>
<p>dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in </p>
<p>vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family </p>
<p>prejudice to which </p>
<p>he attributed her excessive </p>
<p>commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; </p>
<p>and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they </p>
<p>proceeded together up the great staircase. </p>
<p>"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, </p>
<p>"that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who </p>
<p>think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his </p>
<p>tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some </p>
<p>people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of </p>
<p>it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like </p>
<p>other young men." </p>
<p>"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought </p>
<p>Elizabeth. </p>
<p>"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they </p>
<p>walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor </p>
<p>friend." </p>
<p>"Perhaps we might be deceived." </p>
<p>"That is not very likely; our authority was too good." </p>
<p>On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown </p>
<p>into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater </p>
<p>elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were </p>
<p>informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss </p>
<p>Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at </p>
<p>Pemberley. </p>
<p>"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she </p>
<p>walked towards one of the windows. </p>
<p>Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she </p>
<p>should enter the room. "And this is always the way with him," </p>
<p>she added. "Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure </p>
<p>to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for </p>
<p>her." </p>
<p>The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal </p>
<p>bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former </p>
<p>were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the </p>
<p>art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had </p>
<p>willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in </p>
<p>crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and </p>
<p>also more intelligible. </p>
<p>In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they </p>
<p>could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth </p>
<p>walked in quest of the only face whose features would be </p>
<p>known to her. At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking </p>
<p>resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as </p>
<p>she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at </p>
<p>her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest </p>
<p>contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the </p>
<p>gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken </p>
<p>in his father's lifetime. </p>
<p>There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a </p>
<p>more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever </p>
<p>felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation </p>
<p>bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. </p>
<p>What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent </p>
<p>servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered </p>
<p>how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how </p>
<p>much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how </p>
<p>much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that </p>
<p>had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable </p>
<p>to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which </p>
<p>he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she </p>
<p>thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than </p>
<p>it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and </p>
<p>softened its impropriety of expression. </p>
<p>When all of the house that was open to general inspection </p>
<p>had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of </p>
<p>the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who </p>
<p>met them at the hall-door. </p>
<p>As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth </p>
<p>turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, </p>
<p>and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the </p>
<p>building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from </p>
<p>the road, which led behind it to the stables. </p>
<p>They were within twenty yards of each other, and so </p>
<p>abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his </p>
<p>sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were </p>
<p>overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and </p>
<p>for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly </p>
<p>recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to </p>
<p>Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of </p>
<p>perfect civility. </p>
<p>She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his </p>
<p>approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment </p>
<p>impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his </p>
<p>resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been </p>
<p>insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his </p>
<p>master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little </p>
<p>aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and </p>
<p>confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew </p>
<p>not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her </p>
<p>family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last </p>
<p>parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her </p>
<p>embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being </p>
<p>found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which </p>
<p>they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her </p>
<p>life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his </p>
<p>accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his </p>
<p>inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of </p>
<p>her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a </p>
<p>way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts. </p>
<p>At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing </p>
<p>a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly </p>
<p>recollected himself, and took leave. </p>
<p>The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his </p>
<p>figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed </p>
<p>by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was </p>
<p>overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was </p>
<p>the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! </p>
<p>How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light </p>
<p>might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had </p>
<p>purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she </p>
<p>come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was </p>
<p>expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should </p>
<p>have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was </p>
<p>plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted </p>
<p>from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again </p>
<p>over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so </p>
<p>strikingly altered--what could it mean? That he should even </p>
<p>speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to </p>
<p>inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his </p>
<p>manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such </p>
<p>gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did </p>
<p>it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his </p>
<p>letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to </p>
<p>account for it. </p>
<p>They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the </p>
<p>water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of </p>
<p>ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were </p>
<p>approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was </p>
<p>sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically </p>
<p>to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to </p>
<p>direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she </p>
<p>distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed </p>
<p>on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, </p>
<p>where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the </p>
<p>moment was passing in his mind--in what manner he thought </p>
<p>of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still </p>
<p>dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt </p>
<p>himself at ease; yet there had been THAT in his voice which </p>
<p>was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of </p>
<p>pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had </p>
<p>not seen her with composure. </p>
<p>At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her </p>
<p>absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of </p>
<p>appearing more like herself. </p>
<p>They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for </p>
<p>a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots </p>
<p>where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, </p>
<p>were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, </p>
<p>with the long range of woods overspreading many, and </p>
<p>occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a </p>
<p>wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be </p>
<p>beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it </p>
<p>was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued </p>
<p>the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some </p>
<p>time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the </p>
<p>water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a </p>
<p>simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it </p>
<p>was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the </p>
<p>valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the </p>
<p>stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood </p>
<p>which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; </p>
<p>but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their </p>
<p>distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great </p>
<p>walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to </p>
<p>the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, </p>
<p>obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house </p>
<p>on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but </p>
<p>their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able </p>
<p>to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so </p>
<p>much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some </p>
<p>trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he </p>
<p>advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, </p>
<p>they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was </p>
<p>quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk </p>
<p>here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed </p>
<p>them to see him before </p>
<p>they met. Elizabeth, however </p>
<p>astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than </p>
<p>before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if </p>
<p>he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, </p>
<p>she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. </p>
<p>The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him </p>
<p>from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before </p>
<p>them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his </p>
<p>recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as </p>
<p>they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not </p>
<p>got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when </p>
<p>some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that </p>
<p>praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously </p>
<p>construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her </p>
<p>pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of </p>
<p>introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility </p>
<p>for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly </p>
<p>suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of </p>
<p>some of those very people against whom his pride had </p>
<p>revolted in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," </p>
<p>thought she, "when he knows who they are? He takes them </p>
<p>now for people of fashion." </p>
<p>The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as </p>
<p>she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at </p>
<p>him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the </p>
<p>expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such </p>
<p>disgraceful companions. That he was SURPRISED by the </p>
<p>connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with </p>
<p>fortitude, and so far from going away, turned his back with </p>
<p>them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It </p>
<p>was consoling that he should know she had some relations for </p>
<p>whom there was no need to blush. She listened most </p>
<p>attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in </p>
<p>every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked </p>
<p>his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners. </p>
<p>The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as </p>
<p>often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, </p>
<p>offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, </p>
<p>and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was </p>
<p>usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm- </p>
<p>inarm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. </p>
<p>Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the </p>
<p>compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, </p>
<p>however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, </p>
<p>"Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be </p>
<p>for ME--it cannot be for MY sake that his manners are thus </p>
<p>softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a </p>
<p>change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me." </p>
<p>After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in </p>
<p>front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, </p>
<p>after descending to the brink of the river for the better </p>
<p>inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a </p>
<p>little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued </p>
<p>by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm </p>
<p>inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her </p>
<p>husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they </p>
<p>walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. </p>
<p>She wished him to know that she had been assured of his </p>
<p>absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began </p>
<p>by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for </p>
<p>your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would </p>
<p>certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left </p>
<p>Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately </p>
<p>expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, </p>
<p>and said that business with his steward had occasioned his </p>
<p>coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with </p>
<p>whom he had been travelling. "They will join me early to- </p>
<p>morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will </p>
<p>claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters." </p>
<p>Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts </p>
<p>were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's </p>
<p>name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she </p>
<p>might judge by his complexion, HIS mind was not very </p>
<p>differently engaged. </p>
<p>"There is also one other person in the party," he continued </p>
<p>after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to </p>
<p>you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce </p>
<p>my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?" </p>
<p>The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it </p>
<p>was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to </p>
<p>it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy </p>
<p>might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of </p>
<p>her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it </p>
<p>was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him </p>
<p>think really ill of her. </p>
<p>They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in </p>
<p>thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; </p>
<p>but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his </p>
<p>sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon </p>
<p>outstripped the others, and when they had reached the </p>
<p>carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile </p>
<p>behind. </p>
<p>He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared </p>
<p>herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such </p>
<p>a time much might have been said, and silence was very </p>
<p>awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an </p>
<p>embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had </p>
<p>been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale </p>
<p>with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly- </p>
<p>and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before </p>
<p>the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming </p>
<p>up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some </p>
<p>refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each </p>
<p>side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into </p>
<p>the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him </p>
<p>walking slowly towards the house. </p>
<p>The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and </p>
<p>each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to </p>
<p>anything they had expected. "He is perfectly well behaved, </p>
<p>polite, and unassuming," said her uncle. </p>
<p>"There IS something a little stately in him, to be sure," </p>
<p>replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not </p>
<p>unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though </p>
<p>some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it." </p>
<p>"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It </p>
<p>was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no </p>
<p>necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth </p>
<p>was very trifling." </p>
<p>"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome </p>
<p>as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, </p>
<p>for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell </p>
<p>me that he was so disagreeable?" </p>
<p>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that </p>
<p>she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than </p>
<p>before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this </p>
<p>morning. </p>
<p>"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," </p>
<p>replied her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I </p>
<p>shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind </p>
<p>another day, and warn me off his grounds." </p>
<p>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his </p>
<p>character, but said nothing. </p>
<p>"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. </p>
<p>Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have </p>
<p>behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor </p>
<p>Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, </p>
<p>there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. </p>
<p>And there is something of dignity in his countenance that </p>
<p>would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to </p>
<p>be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him </p>
<p>a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud </p>
<p>sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and THAT in </p>
<p>the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue." </p>
<p>Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in </p>
<p>vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave </p>
<p>them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that </p>
<p>by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions </p>
<p>were capable of a very different construction; and that his </p>
<p>character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so </p>
<p>amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In </p>
<p>confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the </p>
<p>pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, </p>
<p>without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such </p>
<p>as such as might be relied on. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they </p>
<p>were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, </p>
<p>every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was </p>
<p>too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the </p>
<p>interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. </p>
<p>Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no </p>
<p>sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former </p>
<p>acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of </p>
<p>a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance. </p>
<p>The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to </p>
<p>leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; </p>
<p>and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be </p>
<p>acquainted with his sister. </p>

<heading>Chapter 44. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his </p>
<p>sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; </p>
<p>and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the </p>
<p>inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; </p>
<p>for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these </p>
<p>visitors came. They had been walking about the place with </p>
<p>some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to </p>
<p>dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the </p>
<p>sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a </p>
<p>gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. </p>
<p>Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it </p>
<p>meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her </p>
<p>relations by acquainting them with the honour which she </p>
<p>expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the </p>
<p>embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the </p>
<p>circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the </p>
<p>preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. </p>
<p>Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there </p>
<p>was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such </p>
<p>a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While </p>
<p>these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the </p>
<p>perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment </p>
<p>increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; </p>
<p>but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the </p>
<p>partiality of the brother should have said too much in her </p>
<p>favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she </p>
<p>naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail </p>
<p>her. </p>
<p>She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and </p>
<p>as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to </p>
<p>compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her </p>
<p>uncle and aunt as made everything worse. </p>
<p>Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable </p>
<p>introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see </p>
<p>that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed </p>
<p>as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that </p>
<p>Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a </p>
<p>very few minutes convinced her that she was only </p>
<p>exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word </p>
<p>from her beyond a monosyllable. </p>
<p>Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; </p>
<p>and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, </p>
<p>and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less </p>
<p>handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good </p>
<p>humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly </p>
<p>unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find </p>
<p>in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such </p>
<p>different feelings. </p>
<p>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her </p>
<p>that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had </p>
<p>barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a </p>
<p>visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and </p>
<p>in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger </p>
<p>against him had been long done away; but had she still felt </p>
<p>any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the </p>
<p>unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on </p>
<p>seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general </p>
<p>way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same </p>
<p>good-humoured ease that he had ever done. </p>
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less </p>
<p>interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to </p>
<p>see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively </p>
<p>attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>and their niece directed their observation towards each with </p>
<p>an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from </p>
<p>those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least </p>
<p>knew what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they </p>
<p>remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was </p>
<p>overflowing with admiration was evident enough. </p>
<p>Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to </p>
<p>ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to </p>
<p>compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in </p>
<p>the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most </p>
<p>sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give </p>
<p>pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, </p>
<p>Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased. </p>
<p>In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; </p>
<p>and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of </p>
<p>his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy </p>
<p>that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice </p>
<p>pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he </p>
<p>was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be </p>
<p>imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to </p>
<p>Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look </p>
<p>appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing </p>
<p>occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his </p>
<p>sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three </p>
<p>little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her </p>
<p>anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not </p>
<p>untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that </p>
<p>might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to </p>
<p>her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in </p>
<p>a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very </p>
<p>long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, </p>
<p>before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months. </p>
<p>We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were </p>
<p>all dancing together at Netherfield." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he </p>
<p>afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by </p>
<p>any of the rest, whether ALL her sisters were at Longbourn. </p>
<p>There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding </p>
<p>remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them </p>
<p>meaning. </p>
<p>It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an </p>
<p>expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she </p>
<p>heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his </p>
<p>companions, as convinced her that the improvement of </p>
<p>manners which she had yesterday witnessed however </p>
<p>temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one </p>
<p>day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and </p>
<p>courting </p>
<p>the </p>
<p>good </p>
<p>opinion of people with whom any </p>
<p>intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace-- </p>
<p>when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the </p>
<p>very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected </p>
<p>their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, </p>
<p>the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, </p>
<p>that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being </p>
<p>visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at </p>
<p>Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen </p>
<p>him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or </p>
<p>unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result </p>
<p>from the success of his endeavours, and when even the </p>
<p>acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed </p>
<p>would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both </p>
<p>of Netherfield as Rosings. </p>
<p>Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and </p>
<p>when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to </p>
<p>join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. </p>
<p>Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before </p>
<p>they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence </p>
<p>which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, </p>
<p>readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of </p>
<p>knowing how SHE, whom the invitation most concerned, felt </p>
<p>disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away </p>
<p>her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance </p>
<p>spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of </p>
<p>the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of </p>
<p>society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to </p>
<p>engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed </p>
<p>on. </p>
<p>Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing </p>
<p>Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and </p>
<p>many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. </p>
<p>Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak </p>
<p>of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some </p>
<p>others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of </p>
<p>considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though </p>
<p>while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager </p>
<p>to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle </p>
<p>and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their </p>
<p>favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to </p>
<p>dress. </p>
<p>But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's </p>
<p>curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It </p>
<p>was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he </p>
<p>was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, </p>
<p>but nothing to justify inquiry. </p>
<p>Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; </p>
<p>and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to </p>
<p>find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had </p>
<p>they drawn his character from their own feelings and his </p>
<p>servant's report, without any reference to any other account, </p>
<p>the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not </p>
<p>have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, </p>
<p>however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became </p>
<p>sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him </p>
<p>since he was four years old, and whose own manners </p>
<p>indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither </p>
<p>had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton </p>
<p>friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had </p>
<p>nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and </p>
<p>if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a </p>
<p>small market-town where the family did not visit. It was </p>
<p>acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did </p>
<p>much good among the poor. </p>
<p>With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he </p>
<p>was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of </p>
<p>his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly </p>
<p>understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting </p>
<p>Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy afterwards discharged. </p>
<p>As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this </p>
<p>evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it </p>
<p>passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her </p>
<p>feelings towards ONE in that mansion; and she lay awake two </p>
<p>whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly </p>
<p>did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she </p>
<p>had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike </p>
<p>against him, that could be so called. The respect created by </p>
<p>the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first </p>
<p>unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be </p>
<p>repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into </p>
<p>somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in </p>
<p>his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable </p>
<p>a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above </p>
<p>respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill </p>
<p>which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not </p>
<p>merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well </p>
<p>enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her </p>
<p>manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations </p>
<p>accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, </p>
<p>would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this </p>
<p>accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, </p>
<p>and without </p>
<p>any indelicate display of regard, or any </p>
<p>peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were </p>
<p>concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and </p>
<p>bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a </p>
<p>man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but </p>
<p>gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as </p>
<p>such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as </p>
<p>by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly </p>
<p>defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, </p>
<p>she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to </p>
<p>know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, </p>
<p>and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she </p>
<p>should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still </p>
<p>possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses. </p>
<p>It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the </p>
<p>niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming </p>
<p>to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for </p>
<p>she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be </p>
<p>imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of </p>
<p>politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be </p>
<p>highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following </p>
<p>morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; </p>
<p>though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little </p>
<p>to say in reply. </p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing </p>
<p>scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive </p>
<p>engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at </p>
<p>Pemberley before noon. </p>
<heading>Chapter 45. </heading>
<p>Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's </p>
<p>dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help </p>
<p>feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be </p>
<p>to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on </p>
<p>that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed. </p>
<p>On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall </p>
<p>into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful </p>
<p>for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a </p>
<p>most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the </p>
<p>house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which </p>
<p>were scattered over the intermediate lawn. </p>
<p>In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was </p>
<p>sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady </p>
<p>with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of </p>
<p>them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment </p>
<p>which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing </p>
<p>wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior </p>
<p>the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and </p>
<p>her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her. </p>
<p>By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by </p>
<p>a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as </p>
<p>such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It </p>
<p>was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable- </p>
<p>looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of </p>
<p>discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of </p>
<p>the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with </p>
<p>occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried </p>
<p>on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to </p>
<p>join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when </p>
<p>there was least danger of its being heard. </p>
<p>Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by </p>
<p>Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially </p>
<p>to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation </p>
<p>would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, </p>
<p>had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she </p>
<p>was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her </p>
<p>own thoughts were employing her. She expected every </p>
<p>moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. </p>
<p>She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be </p>
<p>amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she </p>
<p>could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a </p>
<p>quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, </p>
<p>Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry </p>
<p>after the health of her family. She answered with equal </p>
<p>indifference and brevity, and the others said no more. </p>
<p>The next variation which their visit afforded was produced </p>
<p>by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety </p>
<p>of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till </p>
<p>after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to </p>
<p>Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There </p>
<p>was now employment for the whole party--for though they </p>
<p>could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful </p>
<p>pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected </p>
<p>them round the table. </p>
<p>While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of </p>
<p>deciding whether she most feared or wished for the </p>
<p>appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on </p>
<p>his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before </p>
<p>she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to </p>
<p>regret that he came. </p>
<p>He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two </p>
<p>or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the </p>
<p>river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the </p>
<p>family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner </p>
<p>did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly </p>
<p>easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to </p>
<p>be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she </p>
<p>saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened </p>
<p>against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not </p>
<p>watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no </p>
<p>countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in </p>
<p>Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her </p>
<p>face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had </p>
<p>not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, </p>
<p>exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he </p>
<p>was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and </p>
<p>forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation </p>
<p>on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the </p>
<p>imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with </p>
<p>sneering civility: </p>
<p>"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed </p>
<p>from Meryton? They must be a great loss to YOUR family." </p>
<p>In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's </p>
<p>name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was </p>
<p>uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections </p>
<p>connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting </p>
<p>herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently </p>
<p>answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she </p>
<p>spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a </p>
<p>heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister </p>
<p>overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had </p>
<p>Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her </p>
<p>beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from </p>
<p>the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth </p>
<p>by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed </p>
<p>her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure </p>
<p>her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all </p>
<p>the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family </p>
<p>were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever </p>
<p>reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no </p>
<p>creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, </p>
<p>except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her </p>
<p>brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very </p>
<p>wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their </p>
<p>becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a </p>
<p>plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour </p>
<p>to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might </p>
<p>add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his </p>
<p>friend. </p>
<p>Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his </p>
<p>emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared </p>
<p>not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in </p>
<p>time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her </p>
<p>brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected </p>
<p>her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had </p>
<p>been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to </p>
<p>have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully. </p>
<p>Their visit did not continue long after the question and </p>
<p>answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending </p>
<p>them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings </p>
<p>in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But </p>
<p>Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's recommendation </p>
<p>was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. </p>
<p>And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave </p>
<p>Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than </p>
<p>lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss </p>
<p>Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she </p>
<p>had been saying to his sister. </p>
<p>"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much </p>
<p>altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and </p>
<p>coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have </p>
<p>known her again." </p>
<p>However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an </p>
<p>address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he </p>
<p>perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no </p>
<p>miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. </p>
<p>"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I </p>
<p>never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her </p>
<p>complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all </p>
<p>handsome. Her nose wants character--there is nothing marked </p>
<p>in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common </p>
<p>way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called </p>
<p>so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. </p>
<p>They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; </p>
<p>and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without </p>
<p>fashion, which is intolerable." </p>
<p>Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired </p>
<p>Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending </p>
<p>herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing </p>
<p>him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she </p>
<p>expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a </p>
<p>determination of making him speak, she continued: </p>
<p>"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, </p>
<p>how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; </p>
<p>and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they </p>
<p>had been dining at Netherfield, 'SHE a beauty!--I should as </p>
<p>soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to </p>
<p>improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at </p>
<p>one time." </p>
<p>"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no </p>
<p>longer, "but THAT was only when I first saw her, for it is </p>
<p>many months since I have considered her as one of the </p>
<p>handsomest women of my acquaintance." </p>
<p>He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the </p>
<p>satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any </p>
<p>pain but herself. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred </p>
<p>during their visit, as they returned, except what had </p>
<p>particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of </p>
<p>everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person </p>
<p>who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his </p>
<p>sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but </p>
<p>himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. </p>
<p>Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been </p>
<p>highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject. </p>
<heading>Chapter 46. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding </p>
<p>a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this </p>
<p>disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings </p>
<p>that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining </p>
<p>was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters </p>
<p>from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been </p>
<p>missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane </p>
<p>had written the direction remarkably ill. </p>
<p>They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came </p>
<p>in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, </p>
<p>set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended </p>
<p>to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained </p>
<p>an account of all their little parties and engagements, with </p>
<p>such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which </p>
<p>was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave </p>
<p>more important intelligence. It was to this effect: </p>
<p>"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has </p>
<p>occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am </p>
<p>afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well. What I </p>
<p>have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve </p>
<p>last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel </p>
<p>Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with </p>
<p>one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine </p>
<p>our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly </p>
<p>unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on </p>
<p>both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his </p>
<p>character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet </p>
<p>I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over </p>
<p>it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at </p>
<p>least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our </p>
<p>poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How </p>
<p>thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said </p>
<p>against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off </p>
<p>Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not </p>
<p>missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent </p>
<p>off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten </p>
<p>miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him </p>
<p>here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of </p>
<p>their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my </p>
<p>poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, </p>
<p>but I hardly know what I have written." </p>
<p>Without allowing herself time for consideration, and </p>
<p>scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this </p>
<p>letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost </p>
<p>impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later </p>
<p>than the conclusion of the first. </p>
<p>"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my </p>
<p>hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though </p>
<p>not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot </p>
<p>answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what </p>
<p>I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be </p>
<p>delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham </p>
<p>and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be </p>
<p>assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to </p>
<p>fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came </p>
<p>yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many </p>
<p>hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. </p>
<p>gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna </p>
<p>Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his </p>
<p>belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at </p>
<p>all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking </p>
<p>the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did </p>
<p>trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering </p>
<p>that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed </p>
<p>the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known </p>
<p>after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I </p>
<p>know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry </p>
<p>on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, </p>
<p>anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns </p>
<p>in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--no such </p>
<p>people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest </p>
<p>concern he came on to Longbourn, and </p>
<p>broke his </p>
<p>apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I </p>
<p>am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can </p>
<p>throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very </p>
<p>great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot </p>
<p>think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more </p>
<p>eligible for them to be married privately in town than to </p>
<p>pursue their first plan; and even if HE could form such a </p>
<p>design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which </p>
<p>is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? </p>
<p>Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not </p>
<p>disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head </p>
<p>when I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W. was not a </p>
<p>man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her </p>
<p>room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is </p>
<p>not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw </p>
<p>him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed </p>
<p>their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one </p>
<p>cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have </p>
<p>been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, </p>
<p>as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your </p>
<p>return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if </p>
<p>inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have </p>
<p>just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I </p>
<p>cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as </p>
<p>possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not </p>
<p>afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to </p>
<p>ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel </p>
<p>Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I </p>
<p>am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow </p>
<p>him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and </p>
<p>Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again tomorrow </p>
<p>evening. In such and exigence, my uncle's advice and </p>
<p>assistance would be everything in the world; he will </p>
<p>immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his </p>
<p>goodness." </p>
<p>"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting </p>
<p>from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow </p>
<p>him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as </p>
<p>she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made </p>
<p>him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, </p>
<p>in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's </p>
<p>situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must </p>
<p>leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business </p>
<p>that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose." </p>
<p>"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more </p>
<p>feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not </p>
<p>detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. </p>
<p>and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go </p>
<p>yourself." </p>
<p>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and </p>
<p>she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to </p>
<p>pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she </p>
<p>commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made </p>
<p>her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress </p>
<p>home instantly. </p>
<p>On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support </p>
<p>herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for </p>
<p>Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of </p>
<p>gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid. Is </p>
<p>there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A </p>
<p>glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill." </p>
<p>"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover </p>
<p>herself. "There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; </p>
<p>I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just </p>
<p>received from Longbourn." </p>
<p>She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few </p>
<p>minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched </p>
<p>suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his </p>
<p>concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length </p>
<p>she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such </p>
<p>dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My </p>
<p>younger sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown </p>
<p>herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off </p>
<p>together from Brighton. YOU know him too well to doubt the </p>
<p>rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can </p>
<p>tempt him to-she is lost for ever." </p>
<p>Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she </p>
<p>added in a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have </p>
<p>prevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained </p>
<p>some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own </p>
<p>family! Had his character been known, this could not have </p>
<p>happened. But it is all--all too late now." </p>
<p>"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked. </p>
<p>But is it certain--absolutely certain?" </p>
<p>"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday nig ht, </p>
<p>and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are </p>
<p>certainly not gone to Scotland." </p>
<p>"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to </p>
<p>recover her?" </p>
<p>"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg </p>
<p>my uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, </p>
<p>in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done--I know very well </p>
<p>that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked </p>
<p>on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the </p>
<p>smallest hope. It is every way horrible!" </p>
<p>Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence. </p>
<p>"When MY eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! </p>
<p>had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not- </p>
<p>-I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched </p>
<p>mistake!" </p>
<p>Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, </p>
<p>and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, </p>
<p>his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, </p>
<p>and instantly understood it. Her </p>
<p>power was sinking; </p>
<p>everything MUST sink under such a proof of family </p>
<p>weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She </p>
<p>could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self- </p>
<p>conquest brought nothing to her consolatory to her bosom, </p>
<p>afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, </p>
<p>exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; </p>
<p>and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved </p>
<p>him, as now, when all love must be vain. </p>
<p>But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. </p>
<p>Lydia--the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them </p>
<p>all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her </p>
<p>face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to </p>
<p>everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was </p>
<p>only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her </p>
<p>companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke </p>
<p>compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you </p>
<p>have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to </p>
<p>plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing </p>
<p>concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said </p>
<p>or done on my part that might offer consolation to such </p>
<p>distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which </p>
<p>may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate </p>
<p>affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of </p>
<p>seeing you at Pemberley to-day." </p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. </p>
<p>Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal </p>
<p>the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be </p>
<p>long." </p>
<p>He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his </p>
<p>sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than </p>
<p>there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his </p>
<p>compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting </p>
<p>look, went away. </p>
<p>As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it </p>
<p>was that they should ever see each other again on such terms </p>
<p>of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in </p>
<p>Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the </p>
<p>whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and </p>
<p>varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which </p>
<p>would now have promoted its continuance, and would </p>
<p>formerly have rejoiced in its termination. </p>
<p>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, </p>
<p>Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable </p>
<p>nor faulty. But if otherwise--if regard springing from such </p>
<p>sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is </p>
<p>so often described as arising on a first interview with its </p>
<p>object, and even before two words have been exchanged, </p>
<p>nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given </p>
<p>somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for </p>
<p>Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her </p>
<p>to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that </p>
<p>as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early </p>
<p>example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found </p>
<p>additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. </p>
<p>Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained </p>
<p>a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, </p>
<p>she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. </p>
<p>Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. </p>
<p>While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she </p>
<p>was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry </p>
<p>a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and </p>
<p>how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared </p>
<p>incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an </p>
<p>attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and </p>
<p>though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging </p>
<p>in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no </p>
<p>difficulty in </p>
<p>believing that neither her virtue nor her </p>
<p>understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. </p>
<p>She had never perceived, while the regiment was in </p>
<p>Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she </p>
<p>was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to </p>
<p>attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes </p>
<p>another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them </p>
<p>in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating </p>
<p>but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and </p>
<p>mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did </p>
<p>she now feel it! </p>
<p>She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the </p>
<p>spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly </p>
<p>upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother </p>
<p>incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and </p>
<p>though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for </p>
<p>Lydia, her </p>
<p>uncle's interference seemed of the utmost </p>
<p>importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was </p>
<p>severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, </p>
<p>supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken </p>
<p>suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she </p>
<p>eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading </p>
<p>the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last </p>
<p>with trembling energy, </p>
<p>though Lydia had never been a </p>
<p>favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be </p>
<p>deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; </p>
<p>and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. </p>
<p>Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, </p>
<p>though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; </p>
<p>and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating </p>
<p>to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as </p>
<p>soon as possible. </p>
<p>"But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. </p>
<p>Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for </p>
<p>us; was it so?" </p>
<p>"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our </p>
<p>engagement. THAT is all settled." </p>
<p>"What is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran into her </p>
<p>room to prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to </p>
<p>disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!" </p>
<p>But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse </p>
<p>her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had </p>
<p>Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained </p>
<p>certain that all employment was impossible to one so </p>
<p>wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well </p>
<p>as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be </p>
<p>written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for </p>
<p>their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole </p>
<p>completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his </p>
<p>account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and </p>
<p>Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, </p>
<p>in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, </p>
<p>seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn. </p>

<heading>Chapter 47. </heading>
<p>"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her </p>
<p>uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious </p>
<p>consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as </p>
<p>your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very </p>
<p>unlikely that any young man should form such a design </p>
<p>against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, </p>
<p>and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am </p>
<p>strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her </p>
<p>friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed </p>
<p>again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel </p>
<p>Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!" </p>
<p>"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up </p>
<p>for a moment. </p>
<p>"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of </p>
<p>your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of </p>
<p>decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot </p>
<p>think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so </p>
<p>wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?" </p>
<p>"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every </p>
<p>other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should </p>
<p>be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to </p>
<p>Scotland if that had been the case?" </p>
<p>"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no </p>
<p>absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland." </p>
<p>"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney </p>
<p>coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them </p>
<p>were to be found on the Barnet road." </p>
<p>"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may </p>
<p>be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more </p>
<p>exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very </p>
<p>abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they </p>
<p>could be more economically, though less expeditiously, </p>
<p>married in London than in Scotland." </p>
<p>"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? </p>
<p>Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not </p>
<p>likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, </p>
<p>was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham </p>
<p>will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot </p>
<p>afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she </p>
<p>beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, </p>
<p>for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by </p>
<p>marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of </p>
<p>disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable </p>
<p>elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing </p>
<p>of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your </p>
<p>other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has </p>
<p>no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my </p>
<p>father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention </p>
<p>he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his </p>
<p>family, that HE would do as little, and think as little about it, </p>
<p>as any father could do, in such a matter." </p>
<p>"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but </p>
<p>love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms ot her </p>
<p>than marriage?" </p>
<p>"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied </p>
<p>Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of </p>
<p>decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, </p>
<p>really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her </p>
<p>justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to </p>
<p>think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a </p>
<p>twelvemonth-she has been given up to nothing but amusement </p>
<p>and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the </p>
<p>most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions </p>
<p>that came in her way. Since the ----shire were first quartered </p>
<p>in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been </p>
<p>in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by </p>
<p>thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall </p>
<p>I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally </p>
<p>lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every </p>
<p>charm of person and address that can captivate a woman." </p>
<p>"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so </p>
<p>very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt." </p>
<p>"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, </p>
<p>whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think </p>
<p>capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? </p>
<p>But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We </p>
<p>both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the </p>
<p>word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as </p>
<p>false and deceitful as he is insinuating." </p>
<p>"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, </p>
<p>whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all </p>
<p>alive. </p>
<p>"I do indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you, the </p>
<p>other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you </p>
<p>yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he </p>
<p>spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and </p>
<p>liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances </p>
<p>which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; </p>
<p>but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. </p>
<p>From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared </p>
<p>to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the </p>
<p>contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and </p>
<p>unpretending as we have found her." </p>
<p>"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant </p>
<p>of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?" </p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, </p>
<p>and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel </p>
<p>Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I </p>
<p>returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week </p>
<p>or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to </p>
<p>whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make </p>
<p>our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be </p>
<p>to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood </p>
<p>had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was </p>
<p>settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity </p>
<p>of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. </p>
<p>That SHE could be in any danger from the deception never </p>
<p>entered my head. That such a consequence as THIS could </p>
<p>ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my </p>
<p>thoughts." </p>
<p>"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no </p>
<p>reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?" </p>
<p>"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of </p>
<p>affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been </p>
<p>perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on </p>
<p>which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the </p>
<p>corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all </p>
<p>were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses </p>
<p>about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished </p>
<p>HER by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a </p>
<p>moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her </p>
<p>fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who </p>
<p>treated her with more </p>
<p>favourites." </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty </p>
<p>could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this </p>
<p>interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could </p>
<p>detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. </p>
<p>From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by </p>
<p>the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no </p>
<p>interval of ease or forgetfulness. </p>
<p>They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping </p>
<p>one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the </p>
<p>next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane </p>
<p>could not have been wearied by long expectations. </p>
<p>The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were </p>
<p>standing on the steps of the house as they entered the </p>
<p>paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the </p>
<p>joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself </p>
<p>over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was </p>
<p>the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. </p>
<p>Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a </p>
<p>hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came </p>
<p>running down from her mother's apartment, immediately met </p>
<p>her. </p>
<p>distinction, again became her </p>
<p>Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears </p>
<p>filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether </p>
<p>anything had been heard of the fugitives. </p>
<p>"Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is </p>
<p>come, I hope everything will be well." </p>
<p>"Is my father in town?" </p>
<p>"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word." </p>
<p>"And have you heard from him often?" </p>
<p>"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on </p>
<p>Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give </p>
<p>me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He </p>
<p>merely added that he should not write again till he had </p>
<p>something of importance to mention." </p>
<p>"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?" </p>
<p>"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are </p>
<p>greatly shaken. She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction </p>
<p>in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. </p>
<p>Mary and Kitty are, thank Heaven, are quite well." </p>
<p>"But you--how are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. </p>
<p>How much you must have gone through!" </p>
<p>Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly </p>
<p>well; and their conversation, which had been passing while </p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was </p>
<p>now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane </p>
<p>ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them </p>
<p>both, with alternate smiles and tears. </p>
<p>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions </p>
<p>which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by </p>
<p>the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence </p>
<p>to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the </p>
<p>benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; </p>
<p>she still expected that it would all end well, and that every </p>
<p>morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her </p>
<p>father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce </p>
<p>their marriage. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a </p>
<p>few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as </p>
<p>might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, </p>
<p>invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and </p>
<p>complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming </p>
<p>everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the </p>
<p>errors of her daughter must principally be owing. </p>
<p>"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going </p>
<p>to Brighton, with all my family, THIS would not have </p>
<p>happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. </p>
<p>Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am </p>
<p>sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for </p>
<p>she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been </p>
<p>well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to </p>
<p>have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. </p>
<p>Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I </p>
<p>know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then </p>
<p>he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The </p>
<p>Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if </p>
<p>you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall </p>
<p>do." </p>
<p>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. </p>
<p>Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and </p>
<p>all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very </p>
<p>next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for </p>
<p>recovering Lydia. </p>
<p>"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he; "though it is </p>
<p>right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look </p>
<p>on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. </p>
<p>In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till </p>
<p>we know that they are not married, and have no design of </p>
<p>marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as </p>
<p>I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come </p>
<p>home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may </p>
<p>consult together as to what is to be done." </p>
<p>"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is </p>
<p>exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you </p>
<p>get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they </p>
<p>are not married already, MAKE them marry. And as for </p>
<p>wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia </p>
<p>she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, </p>
<p>after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from </p>
<p>fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am </p>
<p>frightened out of my wits--and have such tremblings, such </p>
<p>flutterings, all over me-such spasms in my side and pains in </p>
<p>my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by </p>
<p>night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any </p>
<p>directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does </p>
<p>not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how </p>
<p>kind you are! I know you will contrive it all." </p>
<p>But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his </p>
<p>earnest endeavours in </p>
<p>the cause, could </p>
<p>not avoid </p>
<p>recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her </p>
<p>fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was </p>
<p>on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the </p>
<p>housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters. </p>
<p>Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there </p>
<p>was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, </p>
<p>they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had </p>
<p>not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, </p>
<p>while they waited at table, and judged it better that ONE only </p>
<p>of the household, and the one whom they could most trust </p>
<p>should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject. </p>
<p>In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and </p>
<p>Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate </p>
<p>apartments to make their appearance before. One came from </p>
<p>her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, </p>
<p>however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in </p>
<p>either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger </p>
<p>which she had herself incurred in this business, had given </p>
<p>more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for </p>
<p>Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to </p>
<p>Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after </p>
<p>they were seated at table: </p>
<p>"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be </p>
<p>much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour </p>
<p>into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly </p>
<p>consolation." </p>
<p>Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, </p>
<p>she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may </p>
<p>draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female </p>
<p>is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; </p>
<p>that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and </p>
<p>that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards </p>
<p>the undeserving of the other sex." </p>
<p>Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too </p>
<p>much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued </p>
<p>to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from </p>
<p>the evil before them. </p>
<p>In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to </p>
<p>be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly </p>
<p>availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, </p>
<p>which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in </p>
<p>general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, </p>
<p>which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss </p>
<p>Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former </p>
<p>continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and </p>
<p>everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me </p>
<p>further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no </p>
<p>apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? </p>
<p>They must have seen them together for ever." </p>
<p>"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some </p>
<p>partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him </p>
<p>any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was </p>
<p>attentive and kind to the utmost. He WAS coming to us, in </p>
<p>order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of </p>
<p>their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first </p>
<p>got abroad, it hastened his journey." </p>
<p>"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not </p>
<p>marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel </p>
<p>Forster seen Denny himself?" </p>
<p>"Yes; but, when questioned by HIM, Denny denied </p>
<p>knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real </p>
<p>opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not </p>
<p>mar-rying--and from THAT, I am inclined to hope, he might </p>
<p>have been misunderstood before." </p>
<p>"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you </p>
<p>entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?" </p>
<p>"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our </p>
<p>brains? I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's </p>
<p>happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his </p>
<p>conduct had not been always quite right. My father and </p>
<p>mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a </p>
<p>match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural </p>
<p>triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's </p>
<p>last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had </p>
<p>known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many </p>
<p>weeks." </p>
<p>"But not before they went to Brighton?" </p>
<p>"No, I believe not." </p>
<p>"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham </p>
<p>himself? Does he know his real character?" </p>
<p>"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham </p>
<p>as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and </p>
<p>extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is </p>
<p>said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may </p>
<p>be false." </p>
<p>"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we </p>
<p>knew of him, this could not have happened!" </p>
<p>"Perhaps it would have been better," replied her sister. </p>
<p>"But to expose the former faults of any person without </p>
<p>knowing what their present feelings were, seemed </p>
<p>unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions." </p>
<p>"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's </p>
<p>note to his wife?" </p>
<p>"He brought it with him for us to see." </p>
<p>Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to </p>
<p>Elizabeth. These were the contents: </p>
<p>"MY DEAR HARRIET, </p>
<p>"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I </p>
<p>cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow </p>
<p>morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna </p>
<p>Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you </p>
<p>a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, </p>
<p>and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, </p>
<p>so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word </p>
<p>at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will </p>
<p>make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and </p>
<p>sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke it will </p>
<p>be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses </p>
<p>to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with </p>
<p>him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he </p>
<p>knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next </p>
<p>ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my </p>
<p>clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell </p>
<p>Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown </p>
<p>before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to </p>
<p>Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey. </p>
<p>"Your affectionate friend, </p>
<p>"LYDIA BENNET." </p>
<p>"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth </p>
<p>when she had finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at </p>
<p>such a moment! But at least it shows that SHE was serious on </p>
<p>the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards </p>
<p>persuade her to, it was not on her side a SCHEME of infamy. </p>
<p>My poor father! how he must have felt it!" </p>
<p>"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a </p>
<p>word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill </p>
<p>immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" </p>
<p>"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging </p>
<p>to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the </p>
<p>day?" </p>
<p>"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at </p>
<p>such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and </p>
<p>though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my </p>
<p>power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! </p>
<p>But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took </p>
<p>from me my faculties." </p>
<p>"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. </p>
<p>You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have </p>
<p>had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone." </p>
<p>"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have </p>
<p>shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right </p>
<p>for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary </p>
<p>studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken </p>
<p>in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after </p>
<p>my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday </p>
<p>with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady </p>
<p>Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday </p>
<p>morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any </p>
<p>of her daughters', if they should be of use to us." </p>
<p>"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; </p>
<p>"perhaps she MEANT well, but, under such a misfortune as </p>
<p>this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance </p>
<p>is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over </p>
<p>us at a distance, and be satisfied." </p>
<p>She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her </p>
<p>father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery </p>
<p>of his daughter. </p>
<p>"He meant I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the </p>
<p>place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and </p>
<p>try if anything could be made out from them. His principal </p>
<p>object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach </p>
<p>which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from </p>
<p>London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a </p>
<p>gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another </p>
<p>might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If </p>
<p>he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had </p>
<p>before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries </p>
<p>there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the </p>
<p>stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other </p>
<p>designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be </p>
<p>gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had </p>
<p>difficulty in finding out even so much as this." </p>
<heading>Chapter 48. </heading>
<p>The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet </p>
<p>the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a </p>
<p>single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all </p>
<p>common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory </p>
<p>correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. </p>
<p>They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing </p>
<p>intelligence to send; but even of THAT they would have been </p>
<p>glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters </p>
<p>before he set off. </p>
<p>When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving </p>
<p>constant information of what was going on, and their uncle </p>
<p>promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to </p>
<p>Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his </p>
<p>sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's </p>
<p>not being killed in a duel. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in </p>
<p>Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her </p>
<p>presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in </p>
<p>their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to </p>
<p>them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited </p>
<p>them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of </p>
<p>cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came </p>
<p>without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's </p>
<p>extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without </p>
<p>leaving them more dispirited than she found them. </p>
<p>All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but </p>
<p>three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He </p>
<p>was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, </p>
<p>and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had </p>
<p>been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody </p>
<p>declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; </p>
<p>and everybody began to find out that they had always </p>
<p>distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though </p>
<p>she did not credit above half of what was said, believed </p>
<p>enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more </p>
<p>certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became </p>
<p>almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come </p>
<p>when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never </p>
<p>before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have </p>
<p>gained some news of them. </p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his </p>
<p>wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his </p>
<p>arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and </p>
<p>persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. </p>
<p>Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, </p>
<p>but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he </p>
<p>was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in </p>
<p>town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone </p>
<p>to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they </p>
<p>procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any </p>
<p>success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, </p>
<p>he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. </p>
<p>Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London </p>
<p>and promised to write again very soon. There was also a </p>
<p>postscript to this effect: </p>
<p>"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, </p>
<p>if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the </p>
<p>regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections </p>
<p>who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now </p>
<p>concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply </p>
<p>to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be </p>
<p>of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide </p>
<p>us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his </p>
<p>power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, </p>
<p>perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, </p>
<p>better than any other person." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this </p>
<p>deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her </p>
<p>power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as </p>
<p>the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having </p>
<p>had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom </p>
<p>had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that </p>
<p>some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give </p>
<p>more information; and though she was not very sanguine in </p>
<p>expecting it, the application was a something to look forward </p>
<p>to. </p>
<p>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the </p>
<p>most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. </p>
<p>The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's </p>
<p>impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to </p>
<p>be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day </p>
<p>was expected to bring some news of importance. </p>
<p>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter </p>
<p>arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. </p>
<p>Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that </p>
<p>came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and </p>
<p>Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, </p>
<p>looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows: </p>
<p>"MY DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my </p>
<p>situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction </p>
<p>you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday </p>
<p>informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear </p>
<p>sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with </p>
<p>you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, </p>
<p>which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from </p>
<p>a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be </p>
<p>wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune-- </p>
<p>or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of </p>
<p>all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of </p>
<p>your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of </p>
<p>this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason </p>
<p>to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this </p>
<p>licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded </p>
<p>from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, </p>
<p>for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined </p>
<p>to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she </p>
<p>could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. </p>
<p>Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in </p>
<p>which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but </p>
<p>likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have </p>
<p>related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that </p>
<p>this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes </p>
<p>of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself </p>
<p>condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a </p>
<p>family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, </p>
<p>with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last </p>
<p>November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been </p>
<p>involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise </p>
<p>you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to </p>
<p>throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, </p>
<p>and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense. </p>
<p>"I am, dear sir, etc., etc." </p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an </p>
<p>answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a </p>
<p>pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a </p>
<p>single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and </p>
<p>it was certain that he had no near one living. His former </p>
<p>acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in </p>
<p>the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular </p>
<p>friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who </p>
<p>could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in </p>
<p>the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very </p>
<p>powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of </p>
<p>discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he </p>
<p>had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable </p>
<p>amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand </p>
<p>pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. </p>
<p>He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were </p>
<p>still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal </p>
<p>these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them </p>
<p>with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is wholly </p>
<p>unexpected. I had not an idea of it." </p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to </p>
<p>see their father at home on the following day, which was </p>
<p>Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their </p>
<p>endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty </p>
<p>that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do </p>
<p>whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for </p>
<p>continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, </p>
<p>she did not express so much satisfaction as her children </p>
<p>expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been </p>
<p>before. </p>
<p>"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she </p>
<p>cried. "Sure he will not leave London before he has found </p>
<p>them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if </p>
<p>he comes away?" </p>
<p>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was </p>
<p>settled that she and the children should go to London, at the </p>
<p>same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, </p>
<p>took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its </p>
<p>master back to Longbourn. </p>
<p>Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about </p>
<p>Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her </p>
<p>from that part of the world. His name had never been </p>
<p>voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind </p>
<p>of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their </p>
<p>being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. </p>
<p>Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come </p>
<p>from Pemberley. </p>
<p>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other </p>
<p>excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, </p>
<p>therefore, could be fairly conjectured from THAT, though </p>
<p>Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted </p>
<p>with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she </p>
<p>known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of </p>
<p>Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she </p>
<p>thought, one sleepless night out of two. </p>
<p>When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his </p>
<p>usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever </p>
<p>been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business </p>
<p>that had taken him away, and it was some time before his </p>
<p>daughters had courage to speak of it. </p>
<p>It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at </p>
<p>tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, </p>
<p>on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have </p>
<p>endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer </p>
<p>but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it." </p>
<p>"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied </p>
<p>Elizabeth. </p>
<p>"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human </p>
<p>nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my </p>
<p>life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of </p>
<p>being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon </p>
<p>enough." </p>
<p>"Do you suppose them to be in London?" </p>
<p>"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?" </p>
<p>"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty. </p>
<p>"She is happy then," said her father drily; "and her </p>
<p>residence there will probably be of some duration." </p>
<p>Then after a short silence he continued: </p>
<p>"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your </p>
<p>advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows </p>
<p>some greatness of mind." </p>
<p>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch </p>
<p>her mother's tea. </p>
<p>"This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good; it gives </p>
<p>such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the </p>
<p>same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering </p>
<p>gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may </p>
<p>defer it till Kitty runs away." </p>
<p>"I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If </p>
<p>I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than </p>
<p>Lydia." </p>
<p>"YOU go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as </p>
<p>Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to </p>
<p>be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is </p>
<p>ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through </p>
<p>the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you </p>
<p>stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out </p>
<p>of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of </p>
<p>every day in a rational manner." </p>
<p>Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to </p>
<p>cry. </p>
<p>"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If </p>
<p>you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a </p>
<p>review at the end of them." </p>

<heading>Chapter 49. </heading>
<p>Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth </p>
<p>were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they </p>
<p>saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding </p>
<p>that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to </p>
<p>meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they </p>
<p>approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, </p>
<p>madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might </p>
<p>have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of </p>
<p>coming to ask." </p>
<p>"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from </p>
<p>town." </p>
<p>"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, </p>
<p>"don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. </p>
<p>Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had </p>
<p>a letter." </p>
<p>Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for </p>
<p>speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast- </p>
<p>room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; </p>
<p>and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their </p>
<p>mother, when they were met by the butler, who said: </p>
<p>"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking </p>
<p>towards the little copse." </p>
<p>Upon this information, they instantly passed through the </p>
<p>hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who </p>
<p>was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on </p>
<p>one side of the paddock. </p>
<p>Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of </p>
<p>running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, </p>
<p>panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out: </p>
<p>"Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from </p>
<p>my uncle?" </p>
<p>"Yes I have had a letter from him by express." </p>
<p>"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?" </p>
<p>"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the </p>
<p>letter from his pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it." </p>
<p>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now </p>
<p>came up. </p>
<p>"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know </p>
<p>myself what it is about." </p>
<p>"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2. </p>
<p>"MY DEAR BROTHER, </p>
<p>"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, </p>
<p>and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you </p>
<p>satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was </p>
<p>fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they </p>
<p>were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to </p>
<p>know they are discovered. I have seen them both--" </p>
<p>"Then it is as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are </p>
<p>married!" </p>
<p>Elizabeth read on: </p>
<p>"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I </p>
<p>find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing </p>
<p>to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on </p>
<p>your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is </p>
<p>required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, </p>
<p>her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among </p>
<p>your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, </p>
<p>moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during </p>
<p>your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are </p>
<p>conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation </p>
<p>in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for </p>
<p>you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in </p>
<p>bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from </p>
<p>these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so </p>
<p>hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has </p>
<p>been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will </p>
<p>be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, </p>
<p>to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I </p>
<p>conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in </p>
<p>your name throughout the whole of this business, I will </p>
<p>immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a </p>
<p>proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for </p>
<p>your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, </p>
<p>and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer </p>
<p>as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have </p>
<p>judged it best that my niece should be married from this </p>
<p>house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to- </p>
<p>day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is </p>
<p>determined on. Yours, etc., </p>
<p>"EDW. GARDINER." </p>
<p>"Is it possible?" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. </p>
<p>"Can it be possible that he will marry her?" </p>
<p>"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought </p>
<p>him," said her sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you." </p>
<p>"And have you answered the letter?" cried Elizabeth. </p>
<p>"No; but it must be done soon." </p>
<p>Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more </p>
<p>time before he wrote. </p>
<p>"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back and write </p>
<p>immediately. Consider how important every moment is in </p>
<p>such a case." </p>
<p>"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the </p>
<p>trouble yourself." </p>
<p>"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done." </p>
<p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked </p>
<p>towards the house. </p>
<p>"And may I ask--" said Elizabeth; "but the terms, I </p>
<p>suppose, must be complied with." </p>
<p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so </p>
<p>little." </p>
<p>"And they MUST marry! Yet he is SUCH a man!" </p>
<p>"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be </p>
<p>done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; </p>
<p>one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it </p>
<p>about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him." </p>
<p>"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, sir?" </p>
<p>"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on </p>
<p>so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, </p>
<p>and fifty after I am gone." </p>
<p>"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not </p>
<p>occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and </p>
<p>something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! </p>
<p>Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A </p>
<p>small sum could not do all this." </p>
<p>"No," said her father; "Wickham's a fool if he takes her </p>
<p>with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be </p>
<p>sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our </p>
<p>relationship." </p>
<p>"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a </p>
<p>sum to be repaid?" </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in </p>
<p>thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their </p>
<p>father then went on to the library to write, and the girls </p>
<p>walked into the breakfast-room. </p>
<p>"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as </p>
<p>soon as they were by themselves. "How strange this is! And </p>
<p>for THIS we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small </p>
<p>as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his </p>
<p>character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!" </p>
<p>"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he </p>
<p>certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for </p>
<p>her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards </p>
<p>clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or </p>
<p>any thing like it, has been advanced. He has children of his </p>
<p>own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten </p>
<p>thousand pounds?" </p>
<p>"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have </p>
<p>been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on </p>
<p>our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done </p>
<p>for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The </p>
<p>kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their </p>
<p>taking her home, and affording her their personal protection </p>
<p>and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years </p>
<p>of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is </p>
<p>actually with them! If such goodness does not make her </p>
<p>miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a </p>
<p>meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" </p>
<p>"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either </p>
<p>side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His </p>
<p>consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is </p>
<p>come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will </p>
<p>steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, </p>
<p>and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their </p>
<p>past imprudence forgotten." </p>
<p>"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as </p>
<p>neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to </p>
<p>talk of it." </p>
<p>It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all </p>
<p>likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They </p>
<p>went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether </p>
<p>he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was </p>
<p>writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied: </p>
<p>"Just as you please." </p>
<p>"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?" </p>
<p>"Take whatever you like, and get away." </p>
<p>Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they </p>
<p>went upstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After </p>
<p>a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had </p>
<p>read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her </p>
<p>joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its </p>
<p>exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from </p>
<p>delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. </p>
<p>To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She </p>
<p>was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any </p>
<p>remembrance of her misconduct. </p>
<p>"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried. "This is delightful </p>
<p>indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be </p>
<p>married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it </p>
<p>would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to </p>
<p>see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the </p>
<p>wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them </p>
<p>directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him </p>
<p>how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring </p>
<p>the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. </p>
<p>My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when </p>
<p>we meet!" </p>
<p>Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the </p>
<p>violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the </p>
<p>obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all </p>
<p>under. </p>
<p>"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, </p>
<p>"in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he </p>
<p>has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money." </p>
<p>"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should </p>
<p>do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, </p>
<p>I and my children must have had all his money, you know; </p>
<p>and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, </p>
<p>except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I </p>
<p>shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it </p>
<p>sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I </p>
<p>am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will </p>
<p>dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father </p>
<p>about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered </p>
<p>immediately." </p>
<p>She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, </p>
<p>muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some </p>
<p>very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some </p>
<p>difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to </p>
<p>be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would be of </p>
<p>small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite </p>
<p>so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head. </p>
<p>"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, </p>
<p>and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I </p>
<p>come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, </p>
<p>run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a </p>
<p>great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you </p>
<p>in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you </p>
<p>heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and </p>
<p>you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her </p>
<p>wedding." </p>
<p>Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth </p>
<p>received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick </p>
<p>of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might </p>
<p>think with freedom. </p>
<p>Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but </p>
<p>that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it </p>
<p>so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness </p>
<p>nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, </p>
<p>in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, </p>
<p>she felt all the advantages of what they had gained. </p>

<heading>an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of </heading>
<heading>his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than </heading>
<heading>ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not </heading>
<heading>have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or </heading>
<heading>credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of </heading>
<heading>prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great </heading>
<heading>Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper </heading>
<heading>place. He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little </heading>
<heading>advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense </heading>
<heading>of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to </heading>
<heading>find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the </heading>
<p>obligation as soon as he could. </p>
<p>When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to </p>
<p>be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. </p>
<p>The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he </p>
<p>should be of age, and the widow and younger children would </p>
<p>by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively </p>
<p>entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain </p>
<p>that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it </p>
<p>was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for </p>
<p>economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone </p>
<p>prevented their exceeding their income. </p>
<p>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it </p>
<p>should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of </p>
<p>the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, </p>
<p>which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no </p>
<p>hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of </p>
<p>grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, </p>
<p>though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper </p>
<p>his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his </p>
<p>willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for </p>
<p>him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be </p>
<p>prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so </p>
<p>little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. </p>
<p>He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the </p>
<p>hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board </p>
<p>and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money </p>
<p>which passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's </p>
<p>expenses had been very little within that sum. </p>
<p>That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his </p>
<p>side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at </p>
<p>present was to have as little trouble in the business as </p>
<p>possible. When the first transports of rage which had </p>
<p>produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally </p>
<p>returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon </p>
<p>dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he </p>
<p>was quick in its execution. He begged to know further </p>
<p>particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too </p>
<p>angry with Lydia to send any message to her. </p>
<p>The good news spread quickly through the house, and with </p>
<p>proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne </p>
<p>in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have </p>
<p>been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia </p>
<p>Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, </p>
<p>been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But </p>
<p>there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good- </p>
<p>natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before </p>
<p>from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of </p>
<p>their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such </p>
<p>an husband her misery was considered certain. </p>
<p>It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; </p>
<p>but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of </p>
<p>her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of </p>
<p>shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a </p>
<p>daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since </p>
<p>Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, </p>
<p>and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those </p>
<p>attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, </p>
<p>and servants. She was busily searching through the </p>
<p>neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, </p>
<p>without knowing or considering what their income might be, </p>
<p>rejected many as deficient in size and importance. </p>
<p>"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could </p>
<p>quit it--or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were </p>
<p>larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have </p>
<p>her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are </p>
<p>dreadful." </p>
<p>Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption </p>
<p>while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, </p>
<p>he said to her: "Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of </p>
<p>these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right </p>
<p>understanding. Into ONE house in this neighbourhood they </p>
<p>shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the </p>
<p>impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn." </p>
<p>A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet </p>
<p>was firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with </p>
<p>amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a </p>
<p>guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she </p>
<p>should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the </p>
<p>occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his </p>
<p>anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable </p>
<p>resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which </p>
<p>her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she </p>
<p>could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace </p>
<p>which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's </p>
<p>nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living </p>
<p>with Wickham a fortnight before they took place. </p>
<p>Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from </p>
<p>the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her </p>
<p>marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the </p>
<p>elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable </p>
<p>beginning from all those who were not immediately on the </p>
<p>spot. </p>
<p>She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. </p>
<p>There were few people on whose secrecy she would have </p>
<p>more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was </p>
<p>no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have </p>
<p>mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear of </p>
<p>disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, </p>
<p>there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's </p>
<p>marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was </p>
<p>not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with </p>
<p>a family where, to every other objection, would now be added </p>
<p>an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man </p>
<p>whom he so justly scorned. </p>
<p>From such a connection she could not wonder that he </p>
<p>would shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she </p>
<p>had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in </p>
<p>rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was </p>
<p>humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly </p>
<p>knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she </p>
<p>could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear </p>
<p>of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining </p>
<p>intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been </p>
<p>happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should </p>
<p>meet. </p>
<p>What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he </p>
<p>know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only </p>
<p>four months ago, would now have been most gladly and </p>
<p>gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as </p>
<p>the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there </p>
<p>must be a triumph. </p>
<p>She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man </p>
<p>who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His </p>
<p>understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have </p>
<p>answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been </p>
<p>to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind </p>
<p>might have been softened, his manners improved; and from </p>
<p>his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she </p>
<p>must have received benefit of greater importance. </p>
<p>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring </p>
<p>multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a </p>
<p>different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, </p>
<p>was soon to be formed in their family. </p>
<p>How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable </p>
<p>independence, she could not imagine. But how little of </p>
<p>permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only </p>
<p>brought together because their passions were stronger than </p>
<p>their virtue, she could easily conjecture. </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. </p>
<p>Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance </p>
<p>of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; </p>
<p>and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be </p>
<p>mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter </p>
<p>was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on </p>
<p>quitting the militia. </p>
<p>"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, </p>
<p>"as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will </p>
<p>agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as </p>
<p>highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. </p>
<p>Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his </p>
<p>former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to </p>
<p>assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in </p>
<p>General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an </p>
<p>advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He </p>
<p>promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where </p>
<p>they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be </p>
<p>more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him </p>
<p>of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy </p>
<p>the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, </p>
<p>with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged </p>
<p>myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying </p>
<p>similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall </p>
<p>subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all </p>
<p>his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston </p>
<p>has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They </p>
<p>will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to </p>
<p>Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my </p>
<p>niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the </p>
<p>South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to </p>
<p>you and your mother.--Yours, etc., </p>
<p>"E. GARDINER." </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of </p>
<p>Wickham's removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. </p>
<p>Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased </p>
<p>with it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had </p>
<p>expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had </p>
<p>by no means given up her </p>
<p>plan of their residing in </p>
<p>Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it </p>
<p>was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment </p>
<p>where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many </p>
<p>favourites. </p>
<p>"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite </p>
<p>shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young </p>
<p>men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so </p>
<p>pleasant in General----'s regiment." </p>
<p>His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of </p>
<p>being admitted into her family again before she set off for the </p>
<p>North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and </p>
<p>Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's </p>
<p>feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her </p>
<p>marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so </p>
<p>rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at </p>
<p>Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was </p>
<p>prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. </p>
<p>And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she </p>
<p>would be able to show her married daughter in the </p>
<p>neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his </p>
<p>permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon </p>
<p>as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. </p>
<p>Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should </p>
<p>consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own </p>
<p>inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last </p>
<p>object of her wishes. </p>
<heading>Chapter 51. </heading>
<p>Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth </p>
<p>felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The </p>
<p>carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return </p>
<p>in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder </p>
<p>Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the </p>
<p>feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the </p>
<p>culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister </p>
<p>must endure. </p>
<p>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast </p>
<p>room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked </p>
<p>impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy. </p>
<p>Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was </p>
<p>thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped </p>
<p>forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave </p>
<p>her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who </p>
<p>followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity </p>
<p>which shewed no doubt of their happiness. </p>
<p>Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then </p>
<p>turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather </p>
<p>gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy </p>
<p>assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to </p>
<p>provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet </p>
<p>was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, </p>
<p>wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, </p>
<p>demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all </p>
<p>sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some </p>
<p>little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a </p>
<p>great while since she had been there. </p>
<p>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but </p>
<p>his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character </p>
<p>and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and </p>
<p>his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would </p>
<p>have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed </p>
<p>him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving </p>
<p>within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of </p>
<p>an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the </p>
<p>cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no </p>
<p>variation of colour. </p>
<p>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother </p>
<p>could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who </p>
<p>happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his </p>
<p>acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured </p>
<p>ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They </p>
<p>seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the </p>
<p>world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and </p>
<p>Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not </p>
<p>have alluded to for the world. </p>
<p>"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I </p>
<p>went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there </p>
<p>have been things enough happened in the time. Good </p>
<p>gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of </p>
<p>being married till I came back again! though I thought it </p>
<p>would be very good fun if I was." </p>
<p>Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth </p>
<p>looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor </p>
<p>saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily </p>
<p>continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am </p>
<p>married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook </p>
<p>William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he </p>
<p>should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, </p>
<p>and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the </p>
<p>window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed </p>
<p>and smiled like anything." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out </p>
<p>of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing </p>
<p>through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them </p>
<p>soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her </p>
<p>mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! </p>
<p>Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I </p>
<p>am a married woman." </p>
<p>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that </p>
<p>embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at </p>
<p>first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see </p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and </p>
<p>to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham" by each of them; and </p>
<p>in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and </p>
<p>boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. </p>
<p>"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to </p>
<p>the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is </p>
<p>not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy </p>
<p>me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must </p>
<p>all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a </p>
<p>pity it is, mamma, we did not all go." </p>
<p>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear </p>
<p>Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be </p>
<p>so?" </p>
<p>"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all </p>
<p>things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and </p>
<p>see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say </p>
<p>there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good </p>
<p>partners for them all." </p>
<p>"I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother. </p>
<p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two </p>
<p>of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands </p>
<p>for them before the winter is over." </p>
<p>"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; </p>
<p>"but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands." </p>
<p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with </p>
<p>them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he </p>
<p>left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a </p>
<p>fortnight. </p>
<p>No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be </p>
<p>so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about </p>
<p>with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. </p>
<p>These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle </p>
<p>was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did </p>
<p>not. </p>
<p>Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had </p>
<p>expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had </p>
<p>scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from </p>
<p>the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on </p>
<p>by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would </p>
<p>have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he </p>
<p>chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his </p>
<p>flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; </p>
<p>and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist </p>
<p>an opportunity of having a companion. </p>
<p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear </p>
<p>Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in </p>
<p>competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; </p>
<p>and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of </p>
<p>September, than any body else in the country. </p>
<p>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting </p>
<p>with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: </p>
<p>"Lizzy, I never gave YOU an account of my wedding, I </p>
<p>believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others </p>
<p>all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?" </p>
<p>"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too </p>
<p>little said on the subject." </p>
<p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went </p>
<p>off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because </p>
<p>Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled </p>
<p>that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and </p>
<p>aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us </p>
<p>at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such </p>
<p>a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would </p>
<p>happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite </p>
<p>distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, </p>
<p>preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a </p>
<p>sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I </p>
<p>was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I </p>
<p>longed to know whether he would be married in his blue </p>
<p>coat." </p>
<p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it </p>
<p>would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, </p>
<p>that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I </p>
<p>was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot </p>
<p>out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or </p>
<p>scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, </p>
<p>however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the </p>
<p>carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon </p>
<p>business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, </p>
<p>when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was </p>
<p>so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to </p>
<p>give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not </p>
<p>be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten </p>
<p>minutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected </p>
<p>afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding </p>
<p>need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well." </p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. </p>
<p>"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you </p>
<p>know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have </p>
<p>said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will </p>
<p>Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!" </p>
<p>"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on </p>
<p>the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further." </p>
<p>"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning </p>
<p>curiosity; "we will ask you no questions." </p>
<p>with </p>
<p>"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly </p>
<p>tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry." </p>
<p>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put </p>
<p>it out of her power, by running away. </p>
<p>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or </p>
<p>at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>had been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and </p>
<p>exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, </p>
<p>and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, </p>
<p>rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied </p>
<p>with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct </p>
<p>in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not </p>
<p>bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote </p>
<p>a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what </p>
<p>Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which </p>
<p>had been intended. </p>
<p>"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my </p>
<p>curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any </p>
<p>of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, </p>
<p>should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write </p>
<p>instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent </p>
<p>reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think </p>
<p>necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with </p>
<p>ignorance." </p>
<p>"Not that I SHALL, though," she added to herself, as she </p>
<p>finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in </p>
<p>an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks </p>
<p>and stratagems to find it out." </p>
<p>Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to </p>
<p>speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; </p>
<p>Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries </p>
<p>would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a </p>
<p>confidante. </p>

<heading>Chapter 52. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her </p>
<p>letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in </p>
<p>possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she </p>
<p>was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the </p>
<p>benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter </p>
<p>convinced her that it did not contain a denial. </p>
<p>"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6. </p>
<p>"MY DEAR NIECE, </p>
<p>"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this </p>
<p>whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a LITTLE </p>
<p>writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must </p>
<p>confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect </p>
<p>it from YOU. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean </p>
<p>to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be </p>
<p>necessary on YOUR side. If you do not choose to understand </p>
<p>me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised </p>
<p>as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party </p>
<p>concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But </p>
<p>if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more </p>
<p>explicit. </p>
<p>"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, </p>
<p>your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, </p>
<p>and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before </p>
<p>I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as </p>
<p>YOUR'S seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner </p>
<p>that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham </p>
<p>were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; </p>
<p>Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he </p>
<p>left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to </p>
<p>town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive </p>
<p>professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself </p>
<p>that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as </p>
<p>to make it impossible for any young woman of character to </p>
<p>love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to </p>
<p>his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it </p>
<p>beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His </p>
<p>character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his </p>
<p>duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which </p>
<p>had been brought on by himself. If he HAD ANOTHER </p>
<p>motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been </p>
<p>some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but </p>
<p>he had something to direct his search, which was more than </p>
<p>WE had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for </p>
<p>his resolving to follow us. </p>
<p>"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some </p>
<p>time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from </p>
<p>her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did </p>
<p>not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, </p>
<p>and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This </p>
<p>Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with </p>
<p>Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon </p>
<p>as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could </p>
<p>get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I </p>
<p>suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did </p>
<p>know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had </p>
<p>gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been </p>
<p>able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up </p>
<p>their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend </p>
<p>procured the wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He </p>
<p>saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His </p>
<p>first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade </p>
<p>her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her </p>
<p>friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, </p>
<p>offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found </p>
<p>Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She </p>
<p>cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she </p>
<p>would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should </p>
<p>be married some time or other, and it did not much signify </p>
<p>when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he </p>
<p>thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very </p>
<p>first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never </p>
<p>been HIS design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the </p>
<p>regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were </p>
<p>very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences </p>
<p>of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign </p>
<p>his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he </p>
<p>could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, </p>
<p>but he did not know where, and he knew he should have </p>
<p>nothing to live on. </p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister </p>
<p>at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, </p>
<p>he would have been able to do something for him, and his </p>
<p>situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, </p>
<p>in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the </p>
<p>hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in </p>
<p>some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he </p>
<p>was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate </p>
<p>relief. </p>
<p>"They met several times, for there was much to be </p>
<p>discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; </p>
<p>but at length was reduced to be reasonable. </p>
<p>"Every thing being settled between THEM, Mr. Darcy's </p>
<p>next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he </p>
<p>first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came </p>
<p>home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, </p>
<p>but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your </p>
<p>father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as </p>
<p>your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till </p>
<p>after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, </p>
<p>and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had </p>
<p>called on business. </p>
<p>"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your </p>
<p>uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of </p>
<p>talk together. </p>
<p>"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It </p>
<p>was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the </p>
<p>express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very </p>
<p>obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of </p>
<p>his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at </p>
<p>different times, but THIS is the true one. Nothing was to be </p>
<p>done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do </p>
<p>not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), </p>
<p>your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. </p>
<p>"They battled it together for a long time, which was more </p>
<p>than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. </p>
<p>But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being </p>
<p>allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with </p>
<p>only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely </p>
<p>against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning </p>
<p>gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation </p>
<p>that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the </p>
<p>praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther </p>
<p>than yourself, or Jane at most. </p>
<p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for </p>
<p>the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I </p>
<p>believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another </p>
<p>thousand in addition to her own settled upon HER, and his </p>
<p>commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be </p>
<p>done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was </p>
<p>owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, </p>
<p>that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and </p>
<p>consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. </p>
<p>Perhaps there was some truth in THIS; though I doubt </p>
<p>whether HIS reserve, or ANYBODY'S reserve, can be </p>
<p>answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, </p>
<p>my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle </p>
<p>would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for </p>
<p>ANOTHER INTEREST in the affair. </p>
<p>"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his </p>
<p>friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed </p>
<p>that he should be in London once more when the wedding </p>
<p>took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last </p>
<p>finish. </p>
<p>"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation </p>
<p>which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least </p>
<p>it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and </p>
<p>Wickham had constant admission to the house. HE was </p>
<p>exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; </p>
<p>but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her </p>
<p>behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by </p>
<p>Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming </p>
<p>home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now </p>
<p>tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly </p>
<p>in the most serious manner, representing to her all the </p>
<p>wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she </p>
<p>had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good </p>
<p>luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite </p>
<p>provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, </p>
<p>and for their sakes had patience with her. </p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia </p>
<p>informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the </p>
<p>next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or </p>
<p>Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I </p>
<p>take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough </p>
<p>to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, </p>
<p>in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in </p>
<p>Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he </p>
<p>wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and THAT, if he </p>
<p>marry PRUDENTLY, his wife may teach him. I thought him </p>
<p>very sly;-he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness </p>
<p>seems the fashion. </p>
<p>"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least </p>
<p>do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never </p>
<p>be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low </p>
<p>phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very </p>
<p>thing. </p>
<p>"But I must write no more. The children have been </p>
<p>wanting me this half hour. </p>
<p>"Yours, very sincerely, </p>
<p>"M. GARDINER." </p>
<p>The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of </p>
<p>spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure </p>
<p>or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled </p>
<p>suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which </p>
<p>she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too </p>
<p>great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, </p>
<p>from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest </p>
<p>extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he </p>
<p>had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification </p>
<p>attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been </p>
<p>necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, </p>
<p>and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason </p>
<p>with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always </p>
<p>most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was </p>
<p>punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a </p>
<p>girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did </p>
<p>whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly </p>
<p>checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even </p>
<p>her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his </p>
<p>affection for her -for a woman who had already refused him-- </p>
<p>as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence </p>
<p>against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of </p>
<p>Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the </p>
<p>connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed </p>
<p>to think how much. But he had given a reason for his </p>
<p>interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It </p>
<p>was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had </p>
<p>liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though </p>
<p>she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she </p>
<p>could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might </p>
<p>assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must </p>
<p>be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, </p>
<p>to know that they were under obligations to a person who </p>
<p>could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of </p>
<p>Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did </p>
<p>she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever </p>
<p>encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards </p>
<p>him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. </p>
<p>Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been </p>
<p>able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's </p>
<p>commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; </p>
<p>but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, </p>
<p>though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she </p>
<p>and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and </p>
<p>confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself. </p>
<p>She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some </p>
<p>one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, </p>
<p>she was overtaken by Wickham. </p>
<p>"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear </p>
<p>sister?" said he, as he joined her. </p>
<p>"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does </p>
<p>not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome." </p>
<p>"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good </p>
<p>friends; and now we are better." </p>
<p>"True. Are the others coming out?" </p>
<p>"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the </p>
<p>carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our </p>
<p>uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley." </p>
<p>She replied in the affirmative. </p>
<p>"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would </p>
<p>be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to </p>
<p>Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? </p>
<p>Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of </p>
<p>course she did not mention my name to you." </p>
<p>"Yes, she did." </p>
<p>"And what did she say?" </p>
<p>"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had </p>
<p>--not turned out well. At such a distance as THAT, you know, </p>
<p>things are strangely misrepresented." </p>
<p>"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she </p>
<p>had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said: </p>
<p>"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We </p>
<p>passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be </p>
<p>doing there." </p>
<p>"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," </p>
<p>said Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him </p>
<p>there at this time of year." </p>
<p>"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at </p>
<p>Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you </p>
<p>had." </p>
<p>"Yes; he introduced us to his sister." </p>
<p>"And do you like her?" </p>
<p>"Very much." </p>
<p>"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved </p>
<p>within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very </p>
<p>promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn </p>
<p>out well." </p>
<p>"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age." </p>
<p>"Did you go by the village of Kympton?" </p>
<p>"I do not recollect that we did." </p>
<p>"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have </p>
<p>had. A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It </p>
<p>would have suited me in every respect." </p>
<p>"How should you have liked making sermons?" </p>
<p>"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of </p>
<p>my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One </p>
<p>ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a </p>
<p>thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would </p>
<p>have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. </p>
<p>Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you </p>
<p>were in Kent?" </p>
<p>"I have heard from authority, which I thought AS GOOD, </p>
<p>that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the </p>
<p>present patron." </p>
<p>"You have. Yes, there was something in THAT; I told you </p>
<p>so from the first, you may remember." </p>
<p>"I DID hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon- </p>
<p>making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at </p>
<p>present; that you actually declared your resolution of never </p>
<p>taking orders, and that the business had been compromised </p>
<p>accordingly." </p>
<p>"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You </p>
<p>may remember what I told you on that point, when first we </p>
<p>talked of it." </p>
<p>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had </p>
<p>walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's </p>
<p>sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good- </p>
<p>humoured smile: </p>
<p>"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you </p>
<p>know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope </p>
<p>we shall be always of one mind." </p>
<p>She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate </p>
<p>gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they </p>
<p>entered the house. </p>
<heading>Chapter 53. </heading>
<p>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly </p>
<p>satisfied with this </p>
<p>conversation that he never again distressed himself, or </p>
<p>provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject </p>
<p>of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to </p>
<p>keep him quiet. </p>
<p>The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her </p>
<p>husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all </p>
<p>going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a </p>
<p>twelvemonth. </p>
<p>"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet </p>
<p>again?" </p>
<p>"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, </p>
<p>perhaps." </p>
<p>"Write to me very often, my dear." </p>
<p>"As often as I can. But you know married women have </p>
<p>never much time for writing. My sisters may write to ME. </p>
<p>They will have nothing else to do." </p>
<p>Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than </p>
<p>his wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty </p>
<p>things. </p>
<p>"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they </p>
<p>were out of the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, </p>
<p>and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I </p>
<p>defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more </p>
<p>valuable son-in-law." </p>
<p>The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for </p>
<p>several days. </p>
<p>"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as </p>
<p>parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without </p>
<p>them." </p>
<p>"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a </p>
<p>daughter," said Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied </p>
<p>that your other four are single." </p>
<p>"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she </p>
<p>is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens </p>
<p>to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have </p>
<p>gone so soon." </p>
<p>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into </p>
<p>was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the </p>
<p>agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to </p>
<p>be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received </p>
<p>orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was </p>
<p>coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several </p>
<p>weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at </p>
<p>Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns. </p>
<p>"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," </p>
<p>(for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). "Well, so much </p>
<p>the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, </p>
<p>you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again. </p>
<p>But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if </p>
<p>he likes it. And who knows what MAY happen? But that is </p>
<p>nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to </p>
<p>mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is </p>
<p>coming?" </p>
<p>"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. </p>
<p>Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and </p>
<p>went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she </p>
<p>told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday </p>
<p>at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the </p>
<p>butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on </p>
<p>Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to </p>
<p>be killed." </p>
<p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming </p>
<p>without changing colour. It was many months since she had </p>
<p>mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they </p>
<p>were alone together, she said: </p>
<p>"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us </p>
<p>of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But </p>
<p>don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused </p>
<p>for the moment, because I felt that I SHOULD be looked at. I </p>
<p>do assure you that the news does not affect me either with </p>
<p>pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; </p>
<p>because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of </p>
<p>MYSELF, but I dread other people's remarks." </p>
<p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not </p>
<p>seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable </p>
<p>of coming there with no other view than what was </p>
<p>acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and </p>
<p>she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there </p>
<p>WITH his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come </p>
<p>without it. </p>
<p>"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor </p>
<p>man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, </p>
<p>without raising all this speculation! I WILL leave him to </p>
<p>himself." </p>
<p>In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to </p>
<p>be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth </p>
<p>could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They </p>
<p>were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen </p>
<p>them. </p>
<p>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between </p>
<p>their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought </p>
<p>forward again. </p>
<p>"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet, "you will wait on him of course." </p>
<p>"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and </p>
<p>promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my </p>
<p>daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a </p>
<p>fool's errand again." </p>
<p>His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such </p>
<p>an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on </p>
<p>his returning to Netherfield. </p>
<p>"'This an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our </p>
<p>society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not </p>
<p>spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time </p>
<p>they go away and come back again." </p>
<p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you </p>
<p>do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my </p>
<p>asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. </p>
<p>Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with </p>
<p>ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him." </p>
<p>Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear </p>
<p>her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to </p>
<p>know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in </p>
<p>consequence of it, before THEY did. As the day of his arrival </p>
<p>drew near: </p>
<p>"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her </p>
<p>sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect </p>
<p>indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually </p>
<p>talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no </p>
<p>one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy </p>
<p>shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!" </p>
<p>"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied </p>
<p>Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; </p>
<p>and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is </p>
<p>denied me, because you have always so much." </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance </p>
<p>of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the </p>
<p>period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long </p>
<p>as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before </p>
<p>their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. </p>
<p>But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she </p>
<p>saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock </p>
<p>and ride towards the house. </p>
<p>Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. </p>
<p>Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to </p>
<p>satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister. </p>
<p>"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; </p>
<p>"who can it be?" </p>
<p>"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am </p>
<p>sure I do not know." </p>
<p>"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to </p>
<p>be with him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud </p>
<p>man." </p>
<p>"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, </p>
<p>any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to </p>
<p>be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him." </p>
<p>Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She </p>
<p>knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore </p>
<p>felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in </p>
<p>seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his </p>
<p>explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. </p>
<p>Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their </p>
<p>mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her </p>
<p>resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, </p>
<p>without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had </p>
<p>sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, </p>
<p>to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. </p>
<p>Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment </p>
<p>towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose </p>
<p>proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had </p>
<p>undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he </p>
<p>was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for </p>
<p>the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an </p>
<p>interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just </p>
<p>as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming- </p>
<p>-at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily </p>
<p>seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known </p>
<p>on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire. </p>
<p>The colour which had been driven from her face, returned </p>
<p>for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of </p>
<p>delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space </p>
<p>of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. </p>
<p>But she would not be secure. </p>
<p>"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then </p>
<p>be early enough for expectation." </p>
<p>She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and </p>
<p>without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried </p>
<p>them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching </p>
<p>the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate </p>
<p>than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, </p>
<p>her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable </p>
<p>ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any </p>
<p>symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance. </p>
<p>Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and </p>
<p>sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not </p>
<p>often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. </p>
<p>He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had </p>
<p>been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him </p>
<p>at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's </p>
<p>presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a </p>
<p>painful, but not an improbable, conjecture. </p>
<p>Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that </p>
<p>short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. </p>
<p>He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility </p>
<p>which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when </p>
<p>contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her </p>
<p>curtsey and address to his friend. </p>
<p>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to </p>
<p>the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from </p>
<p>irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful </p>
<p>degree by a distinction so ill applied. </p>
<p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner </p>
<p>did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, </p>
<p>said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that </p>
<p>was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in </p>
<p>Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could </p>
<p>not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without </p>
<p>bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, </p>
<p>unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to </p>
<p>his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, </p>
<p>and frequently on no </p>
<p>object but the ground. More </p>
<p>thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last </p>
<p>met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry </p>
<p>with herself for being so. </p>
<p>"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did </p>
<p>he come?" </p>
<p>She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but </p>
<p>himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak. </p>
<p>She inquired after his sister, but could do no more. </p>
<p>"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet. </p>
<p>He readily agreed to it. </p>
<p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. </p>
<p>People DID say you meant to quit the place entirely at </p>
<p>Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many </p>
<p>changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went </p>
<p>away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own </p>
<p>daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must </p>
<p>have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The </p>
<p>Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It </p>
<p>was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia </p>
<p>Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or </p>
<p>the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother </p>
<p>Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to </p>
<p>make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?" </p>
<p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. </p>
<p>Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, </p>
<p>therefore, she could not tell. </p>
<p>"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well </p>
<p>married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. </p>
<p>Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. </p>
<p>They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it </p>
<p>seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His </p>
<p>regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving </p>
<p>the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank </p>
<p>Heaven! he has SOME friends, though perhaps not so many </p>
<p>as he deserves." </p>
<p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was </p>
<p>in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. </p>
<p>It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which </p>
<p>nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked </p>
<p>Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at </p>
<p>present. A few weeks, he believed. </p>
<p>"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," </p>
<p>said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many </p>
<p>as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be </p>
<p>vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the </p>
<p>covies for you." </p>
<p>Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such </p>
<p>officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at </p>
<p>present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was </p>
<p>persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious </p>
<p>conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness </p>
<p>could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such </p>
<p>painful confusion. </p>
<p>"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never </p>
<p>more to be in company with either of them. Their society can </p>
<p>afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as </p>
<p>this! Let me never see either one or the other again!" </p>
<p>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer </p>
<p>no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, </p>
<p>from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled </p>
<p>the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he </p>
<p>had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to </p>
<p>be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome </p>
<p>as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, </p>
<p>though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no </p>
<p>difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really </p>
<p>persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was </p>
<p>so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she </p>
<p>was silent. </p>
<p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was </p>
<p>mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and </p>
<p>engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time. </p>
<p>"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, </p>
<p>"for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take </p>
<p>a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not </p>
<p>forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much </p>
<p>disappointed that you did not come back and keep your </p>
<p>engagement." </p>
<p>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said </p>
<p>something of his concern at having been prevented by </p>
<p>business. They then went away. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay </p>
<p>and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very </p>
<p>good table, she did not think anything less than two courses </p>
<p>could be good enough for a man on whom she had such </p>
<p>anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who </p>
<p>had ten thousand a year. </p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to </p>
<p>recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without </p>
<p>interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her. </p>
<p>"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," </p>
<p>said she, "did he come at all?" </p>
<p>She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure. </p>
<p>"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and </p>
<p>aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears </p>
<p>me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why </p>
<p>silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about </p>
<p>him." </p>
<p>Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by </p>
<p>the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful </p>
<p>look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, </p>
<p>than Elizabeth. </p>
<p>"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel </p>
<p>perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be </p>
<p>embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on </p>
<p>Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we </p>
<p>meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance." </p>
<p>"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. </p>
<p>"Oh, Jane, take care." </p>
<p>"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in </p>
<p>danger now?" </p>
<p>"I think you are in very great danger of making him as </p>
<p>much in love with you as ever." </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the </p>
<p>happy schemes, which the good humour and common </p>
<p>politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived. </p>
<p>On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at </p>
<p>Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, </p>
<p>to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very </p>
<p>good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth </p>
<p>eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, </p>
<p>which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her </p>
<p>sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, </p>
<p>forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, </p>
<p>he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and </p>
<p>happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her. </p>
<p>Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his </p>
<p>friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have </p>
<p>imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, </p>
<p>had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, </p>
<p>with an expression of half-laughing alarm. </p>
<p>His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as </p>
<p>showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded </p>
<p>than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to </p>
<p>himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily </p>
<p>secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, </p>
<p>she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It </p>
<p>gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she </p>
<p>was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from </p>
<p>her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her </p>
<p>mother. She knew how little such a situation would give </p>
<p>pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She </p>
<p>was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she </p>
<p>could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how </p>
<p>formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her </p>
<p>mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed </p>
<p>him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at </p>
<p>times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his </p>
<p>kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the </p>
<p>family. </p>
<p>She was in hopes that the evening would afford some </p>
<p>opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the </p>
<p>visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into </p>
<p>something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious </p>
<p>salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the </p>
<p>period which passed in the drawing-room, before the </p>
<p>gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that </p>
<p>almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance </p>
<p>as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the </p>
<p>evening must depend. </p>
<p>"If he does not come to me, THEN," said she, "I shall give </p>
<p>him up for ever." </p>
<p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he </p>
<p>would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had </p>
<p>crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, </p>
<p>and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a </p>
<p>confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her </p>
<p>which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's </p>
<p>approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, </p>
<p>and said, in a whisper: </p>
<p>"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We </p>
<p>want none of them; do we?" </p>
<p>Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She </p>
<p>followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he </p>
<p>spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to </p>
<p>coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! </p>
<p>"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be </p>
<p>foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one </p>
<p>among the sex, who would not protest against such a </p>
<p>weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is </p>
<p>no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" </p>
<p>She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his </p>
<p>coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying: </p>
<p>"Is your sister at Pemberley still?" </p>
<p>"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas." </p>
<p>"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?" </p>
<p>"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on </p>
<p>to Scarborough, these three weeks." </p>
<p>She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to </p>
<p>converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by </p>
<p>her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the </p>
<p>young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away. </p>
<p>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables </p>
<p>placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to </p>
<p>be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown </p>
<p>by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist </p>
<p>players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the </p>
<p>party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were </p>
<p>confined for the evening at different tables, and she had </p>
<p>nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned </p>
<p>towards her side of the room, as to make him play as </p>
<p>unsuccessfully as herself. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield </p>
<p>gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered </p>
<p>before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of </p>
<p>detaining them. </p>
<p>"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to </p>
<p>themselves, "What say you to the day? I think every thing has </p>
<p>passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as </p>
<p>well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a </p>
<p>turn-and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The </p>
<p>soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases' </p>
<p>last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the </p>
<p>partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has </p>
<p>two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never </p>
<p>saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I </p>
<p>asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she </p>
<p>said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at </p>
<p>Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as </p>
<p>good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty </p>
<p>behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them </p>
<p>prodigiously." </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had </p>
<p>seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced </p>
<p>that she would get him at last; and her expectations of </p>
<p>advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far </p>
<p>beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing </p>
<p>him there again the next day, to make his proposals. </p>
<p>"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to </p>
<p>Elizabeth. "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one </p>
<p>with the other. I hope we may often meet again." </p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled. </p>
<p>"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It </p>
<p>mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his </p>
<p>conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without </p>
<p>having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what </p>
<p>his manners now are, that he never had any design of </p>
<p>engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with </p>
<p>greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of </p>
<p>generally pleasing, than any other man." </p>
<p>"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me </p>
<p>smile, and are provoking me to it every moment." </p>
<p>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!" </p>
<p>"And how impossible in others!" </p>
<p>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more </p>
<p>than I acknowledge?" </p>
<p>"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. </p>
<p>We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not </p>
<p>worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, </p>
<p>do not make me your confidante." </p>

<heading>Chapter 55. </heading>
<p>A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and </p>
<p>alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but </p>
<p>was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above </p>
<p>an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet </p>
<p>invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of </p>
<p>concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere. </p>
<p>"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more </p>
<p>lucky." </p>
<p>He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and </p>
<p>if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity </p>
<p>of waiting on them. </p>
<p>"Can you come to-morrow?" </p>
<p>Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her </p>
<p>invitation was accepted with alacrity. </p>
<p>He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were </p>
<p>none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's </p>
<p>room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, </p>
<p>crying out: </p>
<p>"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come-- </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. </p>
<p>Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her </p>
<p>on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair." </p>
<p>"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I </p>
<p>dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up </p>
<p>stairs half an hour ago." </p>
<p>"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be </p>
<p>quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?" </p>
<p>But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be </p>
<p>prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. </p>
<p>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible </p>
<p>again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the </p>
<p>library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her </p>
<p>instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and </p>
<p>Catherine for a considerable time, without making any </p>
<p>impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and </p>
<p>when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the </p>
<p>matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What </p>
<p>am I to do?" </p>
<p>"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then </p>
<p>sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a </p>
<p>precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, </p>
<p>"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of </p>
<p>the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke </p>
<p>her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that SHE </p>
<p>would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half- </p>
<p>opened the door and called out: </p>
<p>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was forced to go. </p>
<p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" </p>
<p>said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I </p>
<p>are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room." </p>
<p>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but </p>
<p>remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of </p>
<p>sight, then returned into the drawing-room. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. </p>
<p>Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the </p>
<p>professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness </p>
<p>rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; </p>
<p>and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, </p>
<p>and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and </p>
<p>command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter. </p>
<p>He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before </p>
<p>he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his </p>
<p>own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to </p>
<p>shoot with her husband. </p>
<p>After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a </p>
<p>word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but </p>
<p>Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must </p>
<p>speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the </p>
<p>stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded </p>
<p>that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's </p>
<p>concurrence. </p>
<p>Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. </p>
<p>Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. </p>
<p>The latter was much more agreeable than his companion </p>
<p>expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in </p>
<p>Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into </p>
<p>silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, </p>
<p>than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned </p>
<p>with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's </p>
<p>invention was again at work to get every body away from him </p>
<p>and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went </p>
<p>into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as </p>
<p>the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be </p>
<p>wanted to counteract her mother's schemes. </p>
<p>But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was </p>
<p>finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to </p>
<p>fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On </p>
<p>opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley </p>
<p>standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest </p>
<p>conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of </p>
<p>both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each </p>
<p>other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward </p>
<p>enough; but HER'S she thought was still worse. Not a syllable </p>
<p>was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going </p>
<p>away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat </p>
<p>down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her </p>
<p>sister, ran out of the room. </p>
<p>Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where </p>
<p>confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, </p>
<p>acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the </p>
<p>happiest creature in the world. </p>
<p>"'This too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not </p>
<p>deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?" </p>
<p>Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a </p>
<p>warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. </p>
<p>Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to </p>
<p>Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, </p>
<p>or say half that remained to be said for the present. </p>
<p>"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not </p>
<p>on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow </p>
<p>her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father </p>
<p>already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will </p>
<p>give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so </p>
<p>much happiness!" </p>
<p>She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely </p>
<p>broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty. </p>
<p>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the </p>
<p>rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that </p>
<p>had given them so many previous months of suspense and </p>
<p>vexation. </p>
<p>"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious </p>
<p>circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! </p>
<p>the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" </p>
<p>In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose </p>
<p>conference with her father had been short and to the purpose. </p>
<p>"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the </p>
<p>door. </p>
<p>"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, </p>
<p>I dare say." </p>
<p>He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the </p>
<p>good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and </p>
<p>heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relation- </p>
<p>ship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her </p>
<p>sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his </p>
<p>own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his </p>
<p>being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of </p>
<p>felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis </p>
<p>the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of </p>
<p>Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her </p>
<p>and himself. </p>
<p>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the </p>
<p>satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet </p>
<p>animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. </p>
<p>Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming </p>
<p>soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her </p>
<p>approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, </p>
<p>though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; </p>
<p>and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and </p>
<p>manner plainly showed how really happy he was. </p>
<p>Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till </p>
<p>their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was </p>
<p>gone, he turned to his daughter, and said: </p>
<p>"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy </p>
<p>woman." </p>
<p>Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him </p>
<p>for his goodness. </p>
<p>"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great </p>
<p>pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not </p>
<p>a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by </p>
<p>no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that </p>
<p>nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant </p>
<p>will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed </p>
<p>your income." </p>
<p>"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money </p>
<p>matters would be unpardonable in me." </p>
<p>"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his </p>
<p>wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five </p>
<p>thousand a year, and very likely more." Then addressing her </p>
<p>daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I </p>
<p>shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I </p>
<p>always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be </p>
<p>so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw </p>
<p>him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought </p>
<p>how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the </p>
<p>handsomest young man that ever was seen!" </p>
<p>Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond </p>
<p>competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for </p>
<p>no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with </p>
<p>her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able </p>
<p>to dispense. </p>
<p>Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; </p>
<p>and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter. </p>
<p>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at </p>
<p>Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always </p>
<p>remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous </p>
<p>neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him </p>
<p>an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to </p>
<p>accept. </p>
<p>Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her </p>
<p>sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to </p>
<p>bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably </p>
<p>useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must </p>
<p>sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached </p>
<p>himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and </p>
<p>when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same </p>
<p>means of relief. </p>
<p>"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by </p>
<p>telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town </p>
<p>last spring! I had not believed it possible." </p>
<p>"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he </p>
<p>account for it?" </p>
<p>"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly </p>
<p>no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot </p>
<p>wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more </p>
<p>advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust </p>
<p>they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn </p>
<p>to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though </p>
<p>we can never be what we once were to each other." </p>
<p>"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that </p>
<p>I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to </p>
<p>see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard." </p>
<p>"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town </p>
<p>last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a </p>
<p>persuasion of MY being indifferent would have prevented his </p>
<p>coming down again!" </p>
<p>"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit </p>
<p>of his modesty." </p>
<p>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his </p>
<p>diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good </p>
<p>qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not </p>
<p>betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had </p>
<p>the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew </p>
<p>it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him. </p>
<p>"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever </p>
<p>existed!" cried Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from </p>
<p>my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see </p>
<p>YOU as happy! If there WERE but such another man for </p>
<p>you!" </p>
<p>"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be </p>
<p>so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I </p>
<p>never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for </p>
<p>myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet </p>
<p>with another Mr. Collins in time." </p>
<p>The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not </p>
<p>be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to </p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do </p>
<p>the same by all her neighbours in Meryton. </p>
<p>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest </p>
<p>family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when </p>
<p>Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to </p>
<p>be marked out for misfortune. </p>

<heading>Chapter 56. </heading>
<p>One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement </p>
<p>with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the </p>
<p>family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention </p>
<p>was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a </p>
<p>carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the </p>
<p>lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, </p>
<p>the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. </p>
<p>The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery </p>
<p>of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it </p>
<p>was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley </p>
<p>instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement </p>
<p>of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the </p>
<p>shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the </p>
<p>remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till </p>
<p>the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was </p>
<p>Lady Catherine de Bourgh. </p>
<p>They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their </p>
<p>astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to </p>
<p>them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt. </p>
<p>She entered the room with an air more than usually </p>
<p>ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than </p>
<p>a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a </p>
<p>word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her </p>
<p>ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had </p>
<p>been made. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a </p>
<p>guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost </p>
<p>politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very </p>
<p>stiffly to Elizabeth, "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That </p>
<p>lady, I suppose, is your mother." </p>
<p>Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was. </p>
<p>"And THAT I suppose is one of your sisters." </p>
<p>"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a </p>
<p>Lady Catherine. "She is my youngest girl but one. My </p>
<p>youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere </p>
<p>about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, </p>
<p>will soon become a part of the family." </p>
<p>"You have a very small park here," returned Lady </p>
<p>Catherine after a short silence. </p>
<p>"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare </p>
<p>say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William </p>
<p>Lucas's." </p>
<p>"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the </p>
<p>evening, in summer; the windows are full west." </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after </p>
<p>dinner, and then added: </p>
<p>"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether </p>
<p>you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well." </p>
<p>"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last." </p>
<p>Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for </p>
<p>her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for </p>
<p>her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely </p>
<p>puzzled. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to </p>
<p>take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, </p>
<p>and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, </p>
<p>rising up, said to Elizabeth, </p>
<p>"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little </p>
<p>wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a </p>
<p>turn in it, if you will favour me with your company." </p>
<p>"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship </p>
<p>about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the </p>
<p>hermitage." </p>
<p>Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her </p>
<p>parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed </p>
<p>through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the </p>
<p>dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, </p>
<p>after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on. </p>
<p>Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that </p>
<p>her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along </p>
<p>the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was </p>
<p>determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman </p>
<p>who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable. </p>
<p>"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as </p>
<p>she looked in her face. </p>
<p>As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began </p>
<p>in the following manner:- </p>
<p>"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the </p>
<p>reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own </p>
<p>conscience, must tell you why I come." </p>
<p>Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment. </p>
<p>"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all </p>
<p>able to account for the honour of seeing you here." </p>
<p>"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you </p>
<p>ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however </p>
<p>insincere YOU may choose to be, you shall not find ME so. </p>
<p>My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and </p>
<p>frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall </p>
<p>certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming </p>
<p>nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your </p>
<p>sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, </p>
<p>but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all </p>
<p>likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own </p>
<p>nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I KNOW it must be a scandalous </p>
<p>falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to </p>
<p>suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting </p>
<p>off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to </p>
<p>you." </p>
<p>"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, </p>
<p>colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took </p>
<p>the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship </p>
<p>propose by it?" </p>
<p>"At once to insist upon having such a report universally </p>
<p>contradicted." </p>
<p>"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," </p>
<p>said Elizabeth coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, </p>
<p>indeed, such a report is in existence." </p>
<p>"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not </p>
<p>been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know </p>
<p>that such a report is spread abroad?" </p>
<p>"I never heard that it was." </p>
<p>"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation </p>
<p>for it?" </p>
<p>"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your </p>
<p>ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to </p>
<p>answer." </p>
<p>"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being </p>
<p>satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of </p>
<p>marriage?" </p>
<p>"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible." </p>
<p>"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of </p>
<p>his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of </p>
<p>infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself </p>
<p>and to all his family. You may have drawn him in." </p>
<p>"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it." </p>
<p>"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been </p>
<p>accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest </p>
<p>relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his </p>
<p>dearest concerns." </p>
<p>"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such </p>
<p>behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit." </p>
<p>"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you </p>
<p>have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, </p>
<p>never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have </p>
<p>you to say?" </p>
<p>"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to </p>
<p>suppose he will make an offer to me." </p>
<p>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied: </p>
<p>"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From </p>
<p>their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was </p>
<p>the favourite wish of HIS mother, as well as of her's. While in </p>
<p>their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment </p>
<p>when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in </p>
<p>their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior </p>
<p>birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to </p>
<p>the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? </p>
<p>To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to </p>
<p>every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard </p>
<p>me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his </p>
<p>cousin?" </p>
<p>"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If </p>
<p>there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I </p>
<p>shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother </p>
<p>and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did </p>
<p>as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion </p>
<p>depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor </p>
<p>inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make </p>
<p>another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept </p>
<p>him?" </p>
<p>"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid </p>
<p>it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed </p>
<p>by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the </p>
<p>inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and </p>
<p>despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will </p>
<p>be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any </p>
<p>of us." </p>
<p>"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the </p>
<p>wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of </p>
<p>happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, </p>
<p>upon the whole, have no cause to repine." </p>
<p>"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this </p>
<p>your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing </p>
<p>due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to </p>
<p>understand, Miss Bennet, that I came </p>
<p>here with the </p>
<p>determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be </p>
<p>dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any </p>
<p>person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking </p>
<p>disappointment." </p>
<p>"THAT will make your ladyship's situation at present more </p>
<p>pitiable; but it will have no effect on me." </p>
<p>"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter </p>
<p>and my nephew are formed for each other. They are </p>
<p>descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; </p>
<p>and, on the </p>
<p>father's, from respectable, honourable, and </p>
<p>ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on both sides </p>
<p>is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of </p>
<p>every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide </p>
<p>them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without </p>
<p>family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it </p>
<p>must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, </p>
<p>you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been </p>
<p>brought up." </p>
<p>"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as </p>
<p>quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's </p>
<p>daughter; so far we are equal." </p>
<p>"True. You ARE a gentleman's daughter. But who was </p>
<p>your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine </p>
<p>me ignorant of their condition." </p>
<p>"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if </p>
<p>your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to </p>
<p>YOU." </p>
<p>"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?" </p>
<p>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of </p>
<p>obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she </p>
<p>could not but say, after a moment's deliberation: </p>
<p>"I am not." </p>
<p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased. </p>
<p>"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an </p>
<p>engagement?" </p>
<p>"I will make no promise of the kind." </p>
<p>"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to </p>
<p>find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive </p>
<p>your self into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go </p>
<p>away till you have given me the assurance I require." </p>
<p>"And I certainly NEVER shall give it. I am not to be </p>
<p>intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your </p>
<p>ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would </p>
<p>my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at </p>
<p>all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, </p>
<p>would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to </p>
<p>bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, </p>
<p>that the arguments with which you have supported this </p>
<p>extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the </p>
<p>application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my </p>
<p>character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions </p>
<p>as these. How far your nephew might approve of your </p>
<p>interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly </p>
<p>no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to </p>
<p>be importuned no farther on the subject." </p>
<p>"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To </p>
<p>all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to </p>
<p>add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest </p>
<p>sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young </p>
<p>man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence </p>
<p>of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my </p>
<p>nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's </p>
<p>steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are </p>
<p>you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus </p>
<p>polluted?" </p>
<p>"You can now have nothing further to say," she resentfully </p>
<p>answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I </p>
<p>must beg to return to the house." </p>
<p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and </p>
<p>they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed. </p>
<p>"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my </p>
<p>nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a </p>
<p>connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of </p>
<p>everybody?" </p>
<p>"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know </p>
<p>my sentiments." </p>
<p>"You are then resolved to have him?" </p>
<p>"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that </p>
<p>manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my </p>
<p>happiness, without reference to YOU, or to any person so </p>
<p>wholly unconnected with me." </p>
<p>"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to </p>
<p>obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are </p>
<p>determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and </p>
<p>make him the contempt of the world." </p>
<p>"Neither duty, nor honour, </p>
<p>nor </p>
<p>gratitude," replied </p>
<p>Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present </p>
<p>instance. No principle of either would be violated by my </p>
<p>marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment </p>
<p>of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former </p>
<p>WERE excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one </p>
<p>moment's concern -and the world in general would have too </p>
<p>much sense to join in the scorn." </p>
<p>"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! </p>
<p>Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss </p>
<p>Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try </p>
<p>you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I </p>
<p>will carry my point." </p>
<p>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at </p>
<p>the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she </p>
<p>added, "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no </p>
<p>compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I </p>
<p>am most seriously displeased." </p>
<p>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to </p>
<p>persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly </p>
<p>into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she </p>
<p>proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the </p>
<p>door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would </p>
<p>not come in again and rest herself. </p>
<p>"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go." </p>
<p>"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here </p>
<p>was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us </p>
<p>the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare </p>
<p>say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as </p>
<p>well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to </p>
<p>you, Lizzy?" </p>
<p>Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; </p>
<p>for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was </p>
<p>impossible. </p>
<heading>Chapter 57. </heading>
<p>The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit </p>
<p>threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could </p>
<p>she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. </p>
<p>Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of </p>
<p>this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking </p>
<p>off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a </p>
<p>rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their </p>
<p>engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to </p>
<p>imagine; till she recollected that HIS being the intimate friend </p>
<p>of Bingley, and HER being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a </p>
<p>time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody </p>
<p>eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself </p>
<p>forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring </p>
<p>them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas </p>
<p>Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the </p>
<p>Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady </p>
<p>Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and </p>
<p>immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at </p>
<p>some future time. </p>
<p>In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she </p>
<p>could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible </p>
<p>consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what </p>
<p>she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it </p>
<p>occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to </p>
<p>her nephew; and how HE might take a similar representation </p>
<p>of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not </p>
<p>pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for </p>
<p>his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was </p>
<p>natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her </p>
<p>ladyship than SHE could do; and it was certain that, in </p>
<p>enumerating the miseries of a marriage with ONE, whose </p>
<p>immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt </p>
<p>would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of </p>
<p>dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to </p>
<p>Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much </p>
<p>good sense and solid reasoning. </p>
<p>If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, </p>
<p>which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so </p>
<p>near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at </p>
<p>once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. </p>
<p>In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might </p>
<p>see him in her way through town; and his engagement to </p>
<p>Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way. </p>
<p>"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise </p>
<p>should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I </p>
<p>shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every </p>
<p>expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied </p>
<p>with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my </p>
<p>affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all." </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their </p>
<p>visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied </p>
<p>it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much </p>
<p>teasing on the subject. </p>
<p>The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was </p>
<p>met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in </p>
<p>his hand. </p>
<p>"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into </p>
<p>my room." </p>
<p>She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what </p>
<p>he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its </p>
<p>being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It </p>
<p>suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and </p>
<p>she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations. </p>
<p>She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat </p>
<p>down. He then said, </p>
<p>"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished </p>
<p>me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you </p>
<p>ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had </p>
<p>two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate </p>
<p>you on a very important conquest." </p>
<p>The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the </p>
<p>instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, </p>
<p>instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most </p>
<p>to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that </p>
<p>his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father </p>
<p>continued: </p>
<p>"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration </p>
<p>in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even YOUR </p>
<p>sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is </p>
<p>from Mr. Collins." </p>
<p>"From Mr. Collins! and what can HE have to say?" </p>
<p>"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins </p>
<p>with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest </p>
<p>daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the </p>
<p>good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your </p>
<p>impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What </p>
<p>relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the </p>
<p>sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this </p>
<p>happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of </p>
<p>another; of which we have been advertised by the same </p>
<p>authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not </p>
<p>long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has </p>
<p>resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be </p>
<p>reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious </p>
<p>personages in this land.' </p>
<p>"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" </p>
<p>'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with </p>
<p>every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid </p>
<p>property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite </p>
<p>of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and </p>
<p>yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure </p>
<p>with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be </p>
<p>inclined to take immediate advantage of.' </p>
<p>"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But </p>
<p>now it comes out: </p>
<p>"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have </p>
<p>reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, </p>
<p>does not look on the match with a friendly eye.' </p>
<p>"MR. DARCY, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I </p>
<p>HAVE surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched </p>
<p>on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name </p>
<p>would have given the lie more effectually to what they </p>
<p>related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see </p>
<p>a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It </p>
<p>is admirable!" </p>
<p>Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could </p>
<p>only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been </p>
<p>directed in a manner so little agreeable to her. </p>
<p>"Are you not diverted?" </p>
<p>"Oh! yes. Pray read on." </p>
<p>"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her </p>
<p>ladyship last night, </p>
<p>she immediately, with her usual </p>
<p>condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when </p>
<p>it become apparent, that on the score of some family </p>
<p>objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her </p>
<p>consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it </p>
<p>my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my </p>
<p>cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what </p>
<p>they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has </p>
<p>not been properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I </p>
<p>am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has </p>
<p>been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their </p>
<p>living together before the marriage took place should be so </p>
<p>generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of </p>
<p>my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at </p>
<p>hearing that you received the young couple into your house as </p>
<p>soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; </p>
<p>and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very </p>
<p>strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive </p>
<p>them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or </p>
<p>allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his </p>
<p>notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only </p>
<p>about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a </p>
<p>young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not </p>
<p>enjoy it. You are not going to be MISSISH, I hope, and </p>
<p>pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, </p>
<p>but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our </p>
<p>turn?" </p>
<p>"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is </p>
<p>so strange!" </p>
<p>"Yes--THAT is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on </p>
<p>any other man it would have been nothing; but HIS perfect </p>
<p>indifference, and YOUR pointed dislike, make </p>
<p>it so </p>
<p>delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not </p>
<p>give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. </p>
<p>Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the </p>
<p>preference even over Wickham, much as I value the </p>
<p>impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, </p>
<p>what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to </p>
<p>refuse her consent?" </p>
<p>To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; </p>
<p>and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was </p>
<p>not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been </p>
<p>more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. </p>
<p>It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. </p>
<p>Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but </p>
<p>wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, </p>
<p>instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too </p>
<p>much. </p>
<heading>Chapter 58. </heading>
<p>Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his </p>
<p>friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was </p>
<p>able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days </p>
<p>had passed after Lady Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived </p>
<p>early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their </p>
<p>having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary </p>
<p>dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed </p>
<p>their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in </p>
<p>the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the </p>
<p>remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, </p>
<p>soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, </p>
<p>while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. </p>
<p>Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of </p>
<p>him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate </p>
<p>resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same. </p>
<p>They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to </p>
<p>call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making </p>
<p>it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on </p>
<p>with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be </p>
<p>executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately </p>
<p>said: </p>
<p>"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake </p>
<p>of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may </p>
<p>be wounding your's. I can no longer help thanking you for </p>
<p>your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I </p>
<p>have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to </p>
<p>you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my </p>
<p>family, I should not have merely my own gratitude </p>
<p>to </p>
<p>express." </p>
<p>"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of </p>
<p>surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of </p>
<p>what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I </p>
<p>did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted." </p>
<p>"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness </p>
<p>first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the </p>
<p>matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the </p>
<p>particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of </p>
<p>all my family, for that generous compassion which induced </p>
<p>you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, </p>
<p>for the sake of discovering them." </p>
<p>"If you WILL thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself </p>
<p>alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add </p>
<p>force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not </p>
<p>attempt to deny. But your FAMILY owe me nothing. Much as </p>
<p>I respect them, I believe I thought only of YOU." </p>
<p>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a </p>
<p>short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to </p>
<p>trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last </p>
<p>April, tell me so at once. MY affections and wishes are </p>
<p>unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this </p>
<p>subject for ever." </p>
<p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness </p>
<p>and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and </p>
<p>immediately, </p>
<p>though </p>
<p>not very fluently, gave him to </p>
<p>understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a </p>
<p>change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her </p>
<p>receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. </p>
<p>The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had </p>
<p>probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the </p>
<p>occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love </p>
<p>can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter </p>
<p>his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of </p>
<p>heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, </p>
<p>though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of </p>
<p>feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to </p>
<p>him, made his affection every moment more valuable. </p>
<p>They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There </p>
<p>was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to </p>
<p>any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for </p>
<p>their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, </p>
<p>who did call on him in her return through London, and there </p>
<p>relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance </p>
<p>of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on </p>
<p>every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's </p>
<p>apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and </p>
<p>assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her </p>
<p>endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she </p>
<p>had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect </p>
<p>had been exactly contrariwise. </p>
<p>"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever al </p>
<p>lowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your </p>
<p>disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, </p>
<p>irrevocably decided against me, you would have </p>
<p>acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly." </p>
<p>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you </p>
<p>know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of </p>
<p>THAT. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could </p>
<p>have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations." </p>
<p>"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, </p>
<p>though </p>
<p>your </p>
<p>accusations were ill-founded, formed on </p>
<p>mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had </p>
<p>merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot </p>
<p>think of it without abhorrence." </p>
<p>"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame </p>
<p>annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of </p>
<p>neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since </p>
<p>then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility." </p>
<p>"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The </p>
<p>recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, </p>
<p>my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been </p>
<p>many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so </p>
<p>well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more </p>
<p>gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know </p>
<p>not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;-- </p>
<p>though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable </p>
<p>enough to allow their justice." </p>
<p>"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so </p>
<p>strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being </p>
<p>ever felt in such a way." </p>
<p>"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of </p>
<p>every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your </p>
<p>countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not </p>
<p>have addressed you in any possible way that would induce </p>
<p>you to accept me." </p>
<p>"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections </p>
<p>will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most </p>
<p>heartily ashamed of it." </p>
<p>Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon </p>
<p>make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any </p>
<p>credit to its contents?" </p>
<p>She explained what its effect on her had been, and how </p>
<p>gradually all her former prejudices had been removed. </p>
<p>"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, </p>
<p>but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. </p>
<p>There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I </p>
<p>should dread your having the power of reading again. I can </p>
<p>remember some expressions which might justly make you </p>
<p>hate me." </p>
<p>"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it </p>
<p>essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we </p>
<p>have both reason to think my </p>
<p>opinions </p>
<p>not </p>
<p>entirely </p>
<p>unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as </p>
<p>that implies." </p>
<p>"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed my </p>
<p>self perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it </p>
<p>was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit." </p>
<p>"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end </p>
<p>so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. </p>
<p>The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who </p>
<p>received it, are now so widely different from what they were </p>
<p>then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to </p>
<p>be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think </p>
<p>only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure." </p>
<p>"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. </p>
<p>Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that </p>
<p>the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, </p>
<p>what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. </p>
<p>Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought </p>
<p>not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in </p>
<p>practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what </p>
<p>was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was </p>
<p>given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and </p>
<p>conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only </p>
<p>child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good </p>
<p>themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent </p>
<p>and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be </p>
<p>selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own </p>
<p>family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to </p>
<p>wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth </p>
<p>compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and </p>
<p>twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, </p>
<p>loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a </p>
<p>lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I </p>
<p>was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my </p>
<p>reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my </p>
<p>pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased." </p>
<p>"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?" </p>
<p>"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I </p>
<p>believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses." </p>
<p>"My manners must have been in fault, but not </p>
<p>intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but </p>
<p>my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have </p>
<p>hated me after THAT evening?" </p>
<p>"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon </p>
<p>began to take a proper direction." </p>
<p>"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, </p>
<p>when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?" </p>
<p>"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise." </p>
<p>"Your surprise could not be greater than MINE in being </p>
<p>noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no </p>
<p>extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to </p>
<p>receive MORE than my due." </p>
<p>"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by </p>
<p>every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent </p>
<p>the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen </p>
<p>your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had </p>
<p>been at tended to. How soon any other wishes introduced </p>
<p>themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an </p>
<p>hour after I had seen you." </p>
<p>He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her </p>
<p>acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden </p>
<p>interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that </p>
<p>interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following </p>
<p>her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed </p>
<p>before he </p>
<p>quitted the inn, and that his gravity and </p>
<p>thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than </p>
<p>what such a purpose must comprehend. </p>
<p>She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a </p>
<p>subject to each, to be dwelt on farther. </p>
<p>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too </p>
<p>busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on </p>
<p>examining their watches, that it was time to be at home. </p>
<p>"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a </p>
<p>wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy </p>
<p>was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him </p>
<p>the earliest information of it. </p>
<p>"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth. </p>
<p>"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon </p>
<p>happen." </p>
<p>"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed </p>
<p>as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found </p>
<p>that it had been pretty much the case. </p>
<p>"On the evening before my going to London," said he, "I </p>
<p>made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have </p>
<p>made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my </p>
<p>former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His </p>
<p>surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I </p>
<p>told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in </p>
<p>supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to </p>
<p>him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her </p>
<p>was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of </p>
<p>directing his friend. </p>
<p>"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, </p>
<p>"when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from </p>
<p>my information last spring?" </p>
<p>"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the </p>
<p>two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced </p>
<p>of her affection." </p>
<p>"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate </p>
<p>conviction to him." </p>
<p>"It did. </p>
<p>Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His </p>
<p>diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment </p>
<p>in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every </p>
<p>thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a </p>
<p>time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself </p>
<p>to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last </p>
<p>winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. </p>
<p>He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer </p>
<p>than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He </p>
<p>has heartily forgiven me now." </p>
<p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a </p>
<p>most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was </p>
<p>invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he </p>
<p>had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to </p>
<p>begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of </p>
<p>course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the </p>
<p>conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they </p>
<p>parted. </p>

<heading>Chapter 59. </heading>
<p>"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" </p>
<p>was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as </p>
<p>she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat </p>
<p>down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had </p>
<p>wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She </p>
<p>coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, </p>
<p>awakened a suspicion of the truth. </p>
<p>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything </p>
<p>extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, </p>
<p>the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a </p>
<p>disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and </p>
<p>Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather KNEW that she was </p>
<p>happy than FELT herself to be so; for, besides the immediate </p>
<p>embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She </p>
<p>anticipated what would be felt in the family when her </p>
<p>situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him </p>
<p>but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike </p>
<p>which not all his fortune and consequence might do away. </p>
<p>At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion </p>
<p>was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was </p>
<p>absolutely incredulous here. </p>
<p>"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be </p>
<p>impossible." </p>
<p>"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence </p>
<p>was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you </p>
<p>do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the </p>
<p>truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged." </p>
<p>Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I </p>
<p>know how much you dislike him." </p>
<p>"You know nothing of the matter. THAT is all to be </p>
<p>forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. </p>
<p>But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. </p>
<p>This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself." </p>
<p>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, </p>
<p>and more seriously assured her of its truth. </p>
<p>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe </p>
<p>you," </p>
<p>cried Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do </p>
<p>congratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question -- </p>
<p>are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?" </p>
<p>"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us </p>
<p>already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But </p>
<p>are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?" </p>
<p>"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or </p>
<p>myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as </p>
<p>impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? </p>
<p>Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. </p>
<p>Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?" </p>
<p>"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel MORE than I ought to </p>
<p>do, when I tell you all." </p>
<p>"What do you mean?" </p>
<p>"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do </p>
<p>Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry." </p>
<p>"My dearest sister, now BE serious. I want to talk very </p>
<p>seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without </p>
<p>delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?" </p>
<p>"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know </p>
<p>when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first </p>
<p>seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." </p>
<p>Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, </p>
<p>produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her </p>
<p>solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that </p>
<p>article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish. </p>
<p>"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as </p>
<p>happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for </p>
<p>nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed </p>
<p>him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can </p>
<p>be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you </p>
<p>have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you </p>
<p>tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all </p>
<p>that I know of it to another, not to you." </p>
<p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been </p>
<p>unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her </p>
<p>own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his </p>
<p>friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his </p>
<p>share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the </p>
<p>night spent in conversation. </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a </p>
<p>window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is </p>
<p>not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he </p>
<p>mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had </p>
<p>no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, </p>
<p>and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with </p>
<p>him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may </p>
<p>not be in Bingley's way." </p>
<p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a </p>
<p>proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be </p>
<p>always giving him such an epithet. </p>
<p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so </p>
<p>expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no </p>
<p>doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said </p>
<p>aloud, "Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in </p>
<p>which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?" </p>
<p>"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice </p>
<p>long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view." </p>
<p>"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; </p>
<p>"but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?" </p>
<p>Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed </p>
<p>a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and </p>
<p>Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get </p>
<p>ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: </p>
<p>"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have </p>
<p>that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not </p>
<p>mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no </p>
<p>occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do </p>
<p>not put yourself to inconvenience." </p>
<p>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's </p>
<p>consent should be asked in the course of the evening. </p>
<p>Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's. </p>
<p>She could not determine how her mother would take it; </p>
<p>sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur </p>
<p>would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But </p>
<p>whether she were violently set against the match, or violently </p>
<p>delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be </p>
<p>equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no </p>
<p>more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her </p>
<p>joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation. </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the </p>
<p>library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her </p>
<p>agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her </p>
<p>father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and </p>
<p>that it should be through her means--that SHE, his favourite </p>
<p>child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be </p>
<p>filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a </p>
<p>wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy </p>
<p>appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved </p>
<p>by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where </p>
<p>she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her </p>
<p>work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in </p>
<p>the library." She was gone directly. </p>
<p>Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and </p>
<p>anxious. "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out </p>
<p>of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always </p>
<p>hated him?" </p>
<p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions </p>
<p>had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It </p>
<p>would have spared her from explanations and professions </p>
<p>which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now </p>
<p>necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her </p>
<p>attachment to Mr. Darcy. </p>
<p>"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is </p>
<p>rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine </p>
<p>carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?" </p>
<p>"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your </p>
<p>belief of my indifference?" </p>
<p>"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant </p>
<p>sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked </p>
<p>him." </p>
<p>"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I </p>
<p>love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly </p>
<p>amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not </p>
<p>pain me by speaking of him in such terms." </p>
<p>"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He </p>
<p>is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse </p>
<p>anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to </p>
<p>YOU, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise </p>
<p>you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I </p>
<p>know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless </p>
<p>you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to </p>
<p>him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the </p>
<p>greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely </p>
<p>escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the </p>
<p>grief of seeing YOU unable to respect your partner in life. </p>
<p>You know not what you are about." </p>
<p>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in </p>
<p>her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the </p>
<p>gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, </p>
<p>relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the </p>
<p>work of a day, but had stood the test of many months </p>
<p>suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, </p>
<p>she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to </p>
<p>the match. </p>
<p>"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I </p>
<p>have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I </p>
<p>could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less </p>
<p>worthy." </p>
<p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him </p>
<p>what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her </p>
<p>with astonishment. </p>
<p>"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did </p>
<p>every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the </p>
<p>fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the bet </p>
<p>ter. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it </p>
<p>been your uncle's doing, I must and WOULD have paid him; </p>
<p>but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own </p>
<p>way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and </p>
<p>storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the </p>
<p>matter." </p>
<p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, </p>
<p>on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her </p>
<p>some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the </p>
<p>room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them </p>
<p>in, for I am quite at leisure." </p>
<p>Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy </p>
<p>weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own </p>
<p>room, she was able to join the others with tolerable </p>
<p>composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the </p>
<p>evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything </p>
<p>material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity </p>
<p>would come in time. </p>
<p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, </p>
<p>she followed her, and made the important communication. Its </p>
<p>effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. </p>
<p>Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it </p>
<p>under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what </p>
<p>she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was </p>
<p>for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a </p>
<p>lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget </p>
<p>about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless </p>
<p>herself. </p>
<p>"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. </p>
<p>Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! </p>
<p>my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What </p>
<p>pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's </p>
<p>is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so pleased--so happy. </p>
<p>Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear </p>
<p>Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much </p>
<p>before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house </p>
<p>in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters </p>
<p>married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of </p>
<p>me. I shall go distracted." </p>
<p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be </p>
<p>doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was </p>
<p>heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had </p>
<p>been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her. </p>
<p>"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! </p>
<p>Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a </p>
<p>Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married </p>
<p>by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to- </p>
<p>morrow." </p>
<p>This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the </p>
<p>gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though </p>
<p>in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure </p>
<p>of her relations' consent, there was still something to be </p>
<p>wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she </p>
<p>expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her </p>
<p>intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, </p>
<p>unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark </p>
<p>her deference for his opinion. </p>
<p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking </p>
<p>pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon </p>
<p>assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem. </p>
<p>"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. </p>
<p>"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like </p>
<p>YOUR husband quite as well as Jane's." </p>

<heading>Chapter 60. </heading>
<p>Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she </p>
<p>wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love </p>
<p>with her. "How could you begin?" said she. "I can </p>
<p>comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once </p>
<p>made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first </p>
<p>place?" </p>
<p>"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the </p>
<p>words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in </p>
<p>the middle before I knew that I HAD begun." </p>
<p>"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my </p>
<p>manners--my behaviour to YOU was at least always bordering </p>
<p>on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather </p>
<p>wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you </p>
<p>admire me for my impertinence?" </p>
<p>"For the liveliness of your mind, I did." </p>
<p>"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very </p>
<p>little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of </p>
<p>deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the </p>
<p>women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking </p>
<p>for YOUR approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, </p>
<p>because I was so unlike THEM. Had you not been really </p>
<p>amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the </p>
<p>pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always </p>
<p>noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the </p>
<p>persons who so assiduously courted you. There--I have saved </p>
<p>you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things </p>
<p>considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be </p>
<p>sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of </p>
<p>THAT when they fall in love." </p>
<p>"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane </p>
<p>while she was ill at Netherfield?" </p>
<p>"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But </p>
<p>make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under </p>
<p>your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as </p>
<p>possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for </p>
<p>teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I </p>
<p>shall begin directly by asking you what made you so </p>
<p>unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy </p>
<p>of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, </p>
<p>especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not </p>
<p>care about me?" </p>
<p>"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no </p>
<p>encouragement." </p>
<p>"But I was embarrassed." </p>
<p>"And so was I." </p>
<p>"You might have talked to me more when you came to </p>
<p>dinner." </p>
<p>"A man who had felt less, might." </p>
<p>"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to </p>
<p>give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I </p>
<p>wonder how long you WOULD have gone on, if you had been </p>
<p>left to yourself. I wonder when you WOULD have spoken, if I </p>
<p>had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your </p>
<p>kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. TOO MUCH, I </p>
<p>am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort </p>
<p>springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have </p>
<p>mentioned the subject. This will never do." </p>
<p>"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be </p>
<p>perfectly fair. Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to </p>
<p>separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am </p>
<p>not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of </p>
<p>expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for </p>
<p>any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me </p>
<p>hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing." </p>
<p>"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to </p>
<p>make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what </p>
<p>did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride </p>
<p>to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any </p>
<p>more serious consequence?" </p>
<p>"My real purpose was to see YOU, and to judge, if I could, </p>
<p>whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed </p>
<p>one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your </p>
<p>sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the </p>
<p>confession to him which I have since made." </p>
<p>"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady </p>
<p>Catherine what is to befall her?" </p>
<p>"I am more likely </p>
<p>to want more time than courage, </p>
<p>Elizabeth. But it ought to done, and if you will give me a </p>
<p>sheet of paper, it shall be done directly." </p>
<p>"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you </p>
<p>and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young </p>
<p>lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer </p>
<p>neglected." </p>
<p>From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy </p>
<p>with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet </p>
<p>answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having THAT </p>
<p>to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she </p>
<p>was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had </p>
<p>already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as </p>
<p>follows: </p>
<p>"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I </p>
<p>ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of </p>
<p>particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You </p>
<p>supposed more than really existed. But NOW suppose as </p>
<p>much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge </p>
<p>your imagination in every possible flight which the subject </p>
<p>will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you </p>
<p>cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise </p>
<p>him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, </p>
<p>again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so </p>
<p>silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We </p>
<p>will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in </p>
<p>the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not </p>
<p>one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only </p>
<p>smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world </p>
<p>that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley </p>
<p>at Christmas. Yours, etc." </p>
<p>Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different </p>
<p>style; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent </p>
<p>to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last. </p>
<p>"DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. </p>
<p>Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady </p>
<p>Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand </p>
<p>by the nephew. He has more to give. </p>
<p>"Yours sincerely, etc." </p>
<p>Miss Bingley's </p>
<p>congratulations to her brother, on his </p>
<p>approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and </p>
<p>insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express </p>
<p>her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. </p>
<p>Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though </p>
<p>feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much </p>
<p>kinder answer than she knew was deserved. </p>
<p>The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar </p>
<p>information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four </p>
<p>sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and </p>
<p>all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister. </p>
<p>Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any </p>
<p>congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn </p>
<p>family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to </p>
<p>Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon </p>
<p>evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly </p>
<p>angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, </p>
<p>really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the </p>
<p>storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her </p>
<p>friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the </p>
<p>course of their meetings she must sometimes think the </p>
<p>pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to </p>
<p>all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He </p>
<p>bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even </p>
<p>listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on </p>
<p>carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and </p>
<p>expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. </p>
<p>James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his </p>
<p>shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight. </p>
<p>Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a </p>
<p>greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as </p>
<p>well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with </p>
<p>the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, </p>
<p>whenever she DID speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her </p>
<p>respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to </p>
<p>make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield </p>
<p>him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious </p>
<p>to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom </p>
<p>he might converse without mortification; and though the </p>
<p>uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the </p>
<p>season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope </p>
<p>of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time </p>
<p>when they should be removed from society so little pleasing </p>
<p>to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party </p>
<p>at Pemberley. </p>

<heading>Chapter 61. </heading>
<p>Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which </p>
<p>Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. </p>
<p>With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. </p>
<p>Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I </p>
<p>could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment </p>
<p>of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her </p>
<p>children produced so happy an effect as to make her a </p>
<p>sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her </p>
<p>life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might </p>
<p>not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that </p>
<p>she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly. </p>
<p>Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his </p>
<p>affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything </p>
<p>else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially </p>
<p>when he was least expected. </p>
<p>Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a </p>
<p>twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton </p>
<p>relations was not desirable even to HIS easy temper, or HER </p>
<p>affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then </p>
<p>gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to </p>
<p>Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other </p>
<p>source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other. </p>
<p>Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her </p>
<p>time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what </p>
<p>she had generally known, her improvement was great. She </p>
<p>was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed </p>
<p>from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper </p>
<p>attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and </p>
<p>less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society </p>
<p>she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham </p>
<p>frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the </p>
<p>promise of balls and young men, her father would never </p>
<p>consent to her going. </p>
<p>Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and </p>
<p>she was necessarily drawn from </p>
<p>the pursuit of </p>
<p>accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit </p>
<p>alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she </p>
<p>could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was </p>
<p>no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' </p>
<p>beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she </p>
<p>submitted to the change without much reluctance. </p>
<p>As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no </p>
<p>revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with </p>
<p>philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become </p>
<p>acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had </p>
<p>before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was </p>
<p>not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on </p>
<p>to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth </p>
<p>received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by </p>
<p>his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. </p>
<p>The letter was to this effect: </p>
<p>"MY DEAR LIZZY, </p>
<p>"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do </p>
<p>my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great </p>
<p>comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else </p>
<p>to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would </p>
<p>like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall </p>
<p>have quite money enough to live upon without some help. </p>
<p>Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; </p>
<p>but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had </p>
<p>rather not. </p>
<p>"Yours, etc." </p>
<p>As it happened that Elizabeth had MUCH rather not, she </p>
<p>endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and </p>
<p>expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her </p>
<p>power to afford, by the practice of what might be called </p>
<p>economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent </p>
<p>them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as </p>
<p>theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in </p>
<p>their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very </p>
<p>insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their </p>
<p>quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to </p>
<p>for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their </p>
<p>manner of living, even when the restoration of peace </p>
<p>dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They </p>
<p>were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap </p>
<p>situation, and always spending more than they ought. His </p>
<p>affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a </p>
<p>little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she </p>
<p>retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had </p>
<p>given her. </p>
<p>Though Darcy could never receive HIM at Pemberley, yet, </p>
<p>for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. </p>
<p>Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was </p>
<p>gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the </p>
<p>Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even </p>
<p>Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so </p>
<p>far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone. </p>
<p>Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's </p>
<p>marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of </p>
<p>visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder </p>
<p>than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as </p>
<p>heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth. </p>
<p>Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment </p>
<p>of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They </p>
<p>were able to love each other even as well as they intended. </p>
<p>Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; </p>
<p>though at first she often listened with an astonishment </p>
<p>bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to </p>
<p>her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect </p>
<p>which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object </p>
<p>of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had </p>
<p>never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she </p>
<p>began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with </p>
<p>her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister </p>
<p>more than ten years younger than himself. </p>
<p>Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage </p>
<p>of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine </p>
<p>frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which </p>
<p>announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very </p>
<p>abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all </p>
<p>intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's </p>
<p>persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and </p>
<p>seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on </p>
<p>the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her </p>
<p>affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife </p>
<p>conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at </p>
<p>Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had </p>
<p>received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but </p>
<p>the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city. </p>
<p>With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate </p>
<p>terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they </p>
<p>were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the </p>
<p>persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the </p>
<p>means of uniting them. </p>
