<heading>Abstract </heading>
The world has suffered the pandemics due to swine flu in the past. The present epidemic in India has claimed many lives. Even, after the first 
outbreak of swine flu in 2009 no concrete efforts are done to prevent this infection. There is an urgent need to take radical steps to prevent such 
epidemics.

<heading>Commentary </heading>
The world has faced annual epidemics and occasional pandemic, 
due to influenza viruses in the past [1]. The World Health 
Organization declared the first pandemic of the 21st century on 
June 11, 2009, caused by swine-origin influenza virus A (H1N1) 
[2,3]. Swine origin influenza was first recognized in the border area 
of Mexico and United States in April 2009 [4]. The currently 
circulating strain of swine origin influenza virus of the H1N1 strain 
has undergone triple reassortment and contains genes from the 
avian, swine and human viruses [4-6]. Swine influenza, also called 
swine flu, hog flu, and pig flu, refers to influenza caused by those 
strains of influenza virus that usually infect pigs [2]. Swine influenza 
is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease of pigs [2]. Human 
transmission occurs by inhalation or ingestion of droplets containing 
viruses from people sneezing or coughing; it is not transmitted by 
eating cooked pork products [7]. In humans, incubation period is 2 
to 7 days [4]. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of 
influenza namely chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe 
headache, coughing, weakness, and general discomfort [2]. 
Clinically, swine flu behaves similarly to seasonal flu. The only 
differentiating characteristics are vomiting and diarrhea in a quarter 
of infected patients, which are rare in seasonal flu [8]. A number of 
cases related to this deadly virus infection are available from all 
corners of the globe. The widespread influenza infection to 
thousands of people has resulted in substantial morbidity, medical 
costs, and time away from work and school [9]. India is a 
developing country. The present epidemic of influenza has led to 
fear, panic and confusion. The Government hospitals are having 
long queues of patients with symptoms of the swine flu. Until 
recently in the national capital New Delhi, only few Government 
hospitals were having facilities to diagnose the disease. This only 
resulted in the bulk inflow of the symptomatic patients to these 
already overburdened hospitals. India reported a total number of 
5,044 reported cases of swine flu in 2012, with 405 fatalities. In 
2013, there were 5,253 cases with 699 deaths. In the year 2015 till 
date so far 875 persons have died in various states. Also, till 
February 23 this year 15,413 persons have been affected by the 
disease [10]. 
However, even after repeated outbreaks in the past, there was no 
effective preparedness for this flu. The government has not made 
substantial efforts for immunizing the vulnerable population against 
this deadly virus. Every year teams are made to study the causes of 
this infection and are expected to find solutions for preventing this 
endemic in the future, but till date all such studies have not found 
any effective way to control the influenza. So far, taking precautions 
seems to be the only way to protect from catching this infection. 
But it is not easy to take precautions by the general public, as it is 
very difficult to educate poor and underprivileged sections of the 
society cover their nose and mouth while coughing and sneezing, to 
wash hands regularly, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth, 
avoiding close contact with sick people and staying home from work 
or school, if one is sick. In a country, where spitting on the roads is 
not a crime, it is almost impossible to control the spread of influenza 
just by taking precautions. The author believes that not only the 
poor and underprivileged who are ignorant, but the situation of the 
well to do families is also alike. There are also no major steps taken 
to inform and educate the masses about this deadly virus infection. 
The situation in healthcare providers is also no different. Rajoura OP 
et al. 2011 highlighted that there were significant gaps between 
knowledge and actual practice of the health care providers 
regarding swine flu [11]. If this is the condition of the health 
workers then how can we expect the general public of a low-income 
country where a major portion of the population are still daily wage 
workers or earn a very small amount, to practice healthy and 
hygienic attitudes? In a country where a small portion of the union 
budget goes to health, it is really difficult to control such epidemics. 
Every year, the winter begins with the same old story of rising 
influenza cases. The problem can't be left as it is with the hope that 
as the summer season will come the influenza will automatically 
diminish. The principal weapon against this seasonal epidemic has 
been effective vaccines for anyone 6 months of age or older who is 
at risk of becoming ill or of transmitting the viruses to others [12]. 
The intra-nasal vaccines are also available for children's above age 
of three year and adults with no known side effects, but the use of 
this vaccine in pregnant women and lactating mothers is not 
indicated [2]. However, so far no efforts have been made to 
immunize at-risk individuals against influenza. As per Ministry of 
health the virus prevalent in India is strain H1N1 and is responsive 
to the two antiviral agents, zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir 
(Tamiflu), and is found to help prevent or reduce the effects of 
swine flu, if taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. As of 
May 5, 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
recommended that health care workers who provide direct care for 
patients with known or suspected swine influenza infection should 
observe contact and droplet precautions, including the use of 
gowns, gloves, eye protection, face masks, and fit-tested, 
disposable N95 respirators [13]. In addition, patients with confirmed 
or suspected swine influenza infection should be placed in a single- 
patient room with the door kept closed and airborne-infection 
isolation rooms with negative-pressure handling should be used 
whenever an aerosol-generating procedure is being performed [13]. 
There are many factors that contribute to the high annual incidence 
of influenza virus, including shortage of medicines and lack of 
reliable diagnostic labs. These factors should be addressed and 
dealt with as a priority. H1N1 infection mandates prompt clinical 
recognition and appropriate patient management. Proper use of 
rapid diagnostic tests in case finding and immediate start of 
treatment for the flu is essential. We cannot just wait for the winters 
to wane, so that the danger will diminish by itself with rising 
temperatures. Behavior modification is an important preventive 
strategy to contain the spread of H1N1 infection [11]. Besides, 
extensive research is essential to find ways to fight the emergence 
of new strains which will continue to haunt public health and the 
scientific communities [1].
