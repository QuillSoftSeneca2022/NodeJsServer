<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>

<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>

<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>

<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>than placebo on day 6, however (Fig. 4B). </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<heading>4. Discussion </heading>
<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>
<p>gavage treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to </p>
<p>infection. The SD for weight change was ±10% or less. Values in parentheses are mg/ </p>
<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>

<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>

<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>infection. The SD for weight change was ±10% or less. Values in parentheses are mg/ </p>
<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>

<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>

<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>

<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>

<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>

<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>

<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>15 </p>
<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>
<p>(Fig. 1A). Body weights were determined during the A/HK-H275Y </p>

<p>ters in the ribavirin treatment group were not significantly lower </p>
<p>than placebo on day 6, however (Fig. 4B). </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>

<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>Fig. 4. Effects of oseltamivir and ribavirin treatment on lung virus titer from mice determined on days 3 (A) and 6 (B) of the infect ion with A/HK-H275Y virus. Oral gavage </p>
<p>treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to infection. The dotted line on each figure indicates the limit of virus detection. Virus titer units are log10 </p>
<p>CCID50/g. Values in parentheses are mg/kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>

<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>

<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>

<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>than placebo on day 6, however (Fig. 4B). </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>
<p>gavage treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to </p>
<p>infection. The SD for weight change was ±10% or less. Values in parentheses are mg/ </p>
<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>

<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>

<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>

<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>

<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>than placebo on day 6, however (Fig. 4B). </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<heading>4. Discussion </heading>
<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>
<p>gavage treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to </p>
<p>infection. The SD for weight change was ±10% or less. Values in parentheses are mg/ </p>
<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>

<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>

<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>

<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>

<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>ters in the ribavirin treatment group were not significantly lower </p>
<p>than placebo on day 6, however (Fig. 4B). </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>
<p>gavage treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to </p>
<p>infection. The SD for weight change was ±10% or less. Values in parentheses are mg/ </p>
<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to infection. The dotted line on each figure indicates the limit of virus detection. Virus titer units are log10 </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>

<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>

<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>

<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>than placebo on day 6, however (Fig. 4B). </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>
<p>gavage treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to </p>
<p>infection. The SD for weight change was ±10% or less. Values in parentheses are mg/ </p>
<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>

<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>

<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>

<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>

<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>than placebo on day 6, however (Fig. 4B). </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<heading>4. Discussion </heading>
<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>
<p>gavage treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to </p>
<p>infection. The SD for weight change was ±10% or less. Values in parentheses are mg/ </p>
<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>

<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>

<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>

<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>

<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>ters in the ribavirin treatment group were not significantly lower </p>
<p>than placebo on day 6, however (Fig. 4B). </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>

<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>

<p>Influenza A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) viruses containing the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene mutation H275Y (conferring resistance to oseltamivir) were adapted to mice and </p>
<p>evaluated for suitability as models for lethal infection and antiviral treatment. The viral neuraminidases </p>
<p>were resistant to peramivir and oseltamivir carboxylate but sensitive to zanamivir. Similar pattern of </p>
<p>antiviral activity were seen in MDCK cell assays. Lethal infections were achieved in mice with the two </p>
<p>viruses. Oral oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day bid for 5 day starting at !2 h gave 30% and 60% pro- </p>
<p>tection from death, respectively, due to the A/Mississippi/03/2001 infection. Intraperitoneal treatments </p>
<p>with zanamivir at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 60% and 90% protection, respectively. Nei- </p>
<p>ther compound at <300 mg/kg/day protected mice when treatments began at +24 h. Amantadine was </p>
<p>effective at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine was protective at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (highest dose </p>
<p>tested), and ribavirin was active at 30 and 75 mg/kg/day, with survival ranging from 60–100% for oral </p>
<p>treatments initiated at !2 h. For treatments begun at +24 h, amantadine was protective at 30 and </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day, rimantadine showed efficacy at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, and ribavirin was active at </p>
<p>75 mg/kg/day, with 60–100% survival per group. In the A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 infection, oral oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day starting at !2 h gave 50% and 70% protection from death, respectively. </p>
<p>These infection models will be useful to study newly discovered anti-influenza virus agents and to eval- </p>
<p>uate compounds in combination. </p>

<heading>1. Introduction </heading>
<p>Virus resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has become the </p>
<p>subject of increasing concern, based upon a higher frequency of </p>
<p>isolating such viruses from infected patients (Besselaar et al., </p>
<heading>2008; Dharan et al., 2009; Meijer et al., 2009). Prior to the H1N1 </heading>
<p>pandemic of 2009, the frequency of oseltamivir-resistant viruses </p>
<p>was as high as 68% in certain regions of the world (Meijer et al., </p>
<p>2009). Fortunately, the 2009 H1N1 virus was sensitive to oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir, although it was completely resistant to the drugs amantadine </p>
<heading>and rimantadine (Gubareva et al., 2010; Mossad, 2009). An analysis </heading>
<p>of treatment benefit during the pandemic indicated that oseltami- </p>
<p>vir initiated prior to the first 48 h reduced morbidity and mortality </p>
<p>in severe cases (Smith et al., 2011). In addition, prophylaxis of indi- </p>
<p>viduals in contact with influenza-afflicted persons provided signif- </p>
<p>icant protection from infection (Smith et al., 2011). As the </p>
<p>pandemic progressed and treatments with oseltamivir were given, </p>
<p>some oseltamivir-resistant viruses were isolated and characterized </p>

<heading>(Chen et al., 2009; Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). The </heading>
<p>predominant mutation conferring resistance to oseltamivir was in </p>
<p>the viral neuraminidase at position 275 where histidine was re- </p>
<p>placed by tyrosine (H275Y). However, the overall incidence of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant virus isolation was only about 1% of isolates </p>
<p>(Thorlund et al., 2011). This situation could change from year to </p>
<p>year, based upon finding up to 68% of virus isolates resistant to </p>
<p>oseltamivir prior to 2009 (Meijer et al., 2009). The effectiveness </p>
<p>of treatment of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus infections </p>
<p>has been shown to be reduced in pediatric clinical settings (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). A fatal case of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 H275Y virus </p>
<p>infection was recently reported from Korea (Hong et al., 2011), </p>
<p>underscoring the virulence potential of the resistant virus. </p>
<p>Animal models, particularly mice and to a lesser extent ferrets, </p>
<p>are routinely used to study treatment of influenza virus infections </p>
<p>with existing drugs or new compounds (Barnard, 2009; Sidwell </p>
<p>and Smee, 2000). Such studies have primarily entailed the use of </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive viruses. This is because neur- </p>
<p>aminidase-resistant viruses have historically been weakly virulent </p>
<heading>in mice or ferrets (Carr et al., 2002; Ives et al., 2002). More recently </heading>
<p>this situation has changed. In 2009 Boivin et al. reported a mouse- </p>
<p>adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y (referred to as H274Y </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>in the publication) infection model in mice (Baz et al., 2009). Note </p>
<p>that prior to 2009 the convention for identifying amino acids in the </p>
<p>viral neuraminidase followed H3N2 numbering, which differs in </p>
<p>initial length from H1N1 by one amino acid. Thus, all earlier </p>
<p>H1N1 viruses with an H275Y mutation were referred to as </p>
<p>H274Y. In the present article the viruses are all referred to as </p>
<p>H275Y. </p>
<p>The H275Y virus that was used for the studies of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) was created by genetic engineering. Oseltamivir was found </p>
<p>to be ineffective in treating the infection when administered up to </p>
<p>10 mg/kg/day. However, an experimental neuraminidase inhibitor, </p>
<p>A-322278, did show some efficacy in treating this infection. In that </p>
<p>study the efficacy of higher doses of oseltamivir were not deter- </p>
<p>mined. Yen and colleagues engineered an influenza A/Vietnam/ </p>
<p>1203/2004 (H5N1) virus with an H275Y mutation that conferred </p>
<p>oseltamivir resistance and yet retained lethality in mice (Yen </p>
<p>et al., 2007). Antiviral studies with this virus have not been re- </p>
<p>ported. We are not aware of any influenza A (H3N2) or influenza </p>
<p>B viruses adapted to mice that are resistant to oseltamivir. </p>
<p>The H1N1 virus that emerged in 2009 was found to be lethal in </p>
<p>mice following adaptation (Ilyushina et al., 2010), and some virus </p>
<p>isolates were even able to cause mortality without adaptation in </p>
<p>certain strains of mice (Otte et al., 2011). The influenza A/Califor- </p>
<p>nia/04/2009 (H1N1) virus that was mouse adapted had the follow- </p>
<p>ing mutations compared to wild-type virus: 1 in PB2 (E158G), 3 in </p>
<p>HA (G155E, S183P, and D222G), and 1 in NP (D101G) genes (Ily- </p>
<heading>ushina et al., 2010). Later, certain oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 </heading>
<p>viruses were isolated and found to cause disease in mice and fer- </p>
<p>rets (Hamelin et al., 2010). It is possible that these isolates may </p>
<p>be appropriate for antiviral studies in animals. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work was to develop an oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus suitable for chemotherapy experiments in mice, and </p>
<p>then to determine its susceptibility in the mouse model to various </p>
<p>antiviral agents. Our efforts began prior to the emergence of the </p>
<p>2009 pandemic and before the published work of Baz et al. </p>
<p>(2009) with the genetically engineered influenza A/WSN/33 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y virus. Because we were aware that mouse-adapted </p>
<p>strains might only produce partially lethal infections in mice, sev- </p>
<p>eral strains of virus were investigated. The viruses that we used </p>
<p>were those that became available to us for research purposes. </p>
<p>We determined that a mouse-adapted influenza A/Mississippi/03/ </p>
<p>2001 (H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/MS-H275Y) was </p>
<p>consistently lethal to BALB/c mice in repeated experiments. A pan- </p>
<p>demic virus resistant to oseltamivir, A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y (hereafter referred to as A/HK-275Y), was acquired </p>
<p>by us and subsequently adapted for lethality in mice. Another virus </p>
<p>strain serially passaged in mice, influenza A/Hawaii/21/2007 </p>
<p>(H1N1) H275Y, was found to only be partially lethal to the animals, </p>
<p>and no further work was done with that virus. </p>
<p>In the present studies we demonstrate the efficacy of several </p>
<p>influenza virus inhibitors over a range of doses in mice lethally in- </p>
<p>fected with the A/MS-H275Y and the A/HK-H275Y viruses. Infec- </p>
<p>tions of mice with these novel mouse adapted strains, </p>
<p>particularly A/MS-H275Y, will be useful as models for studying </p>
<p>treatment regimens that may combat oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infections. </p>
<heading>2. Materials and methods </heading>
<p>Antiviral compounds </p>
<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were purchased from Sigma (St. </p>
<p>Louis, MO, USA). Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as </p>
<p>oseltamivir) was obtained from Tamiflu® capsules that were pur- </p>
<p>chased from a local pharmacy. Oseltamivir carboxylate, the active </p>
<p>form of oseltamivir, was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals </p>
<p>(Emeryville, CA, USA). Peramivir was kindly provided by BioCryst </p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals (Birmingham, AL, USA). Zanamivir was purchased </p>
<p>from Haorui Pharma-Chem (Edison, NJ, USA). Ribavirin was ob- </p>
<p>tained from the former ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA, </p>
<p>USA). All compounds, except zanamivir, were prepared in water </p>
<p>for oral gavage treatment of mice. Water served as the oral gavage </p>
<p>placebo. Zanamivir was prepared in sterile saline for intraperito- </p>
<p>neal injection, and sterile saline served as the placebo for studies </p>
<p>with zanamivir in mice. Because oseltamivir was used from phar- </p>
<p>maceutical capsules that also contained excipients, the entire con- </p>
<p>tents of 75 mg capsules minus the shell were added to water to </p>
<p>make up the highest mg/kg/day dose. Lower doses of oseltamivir </p>
<p>were prepared by dilution. We have previously reported that osel- </p>
<p>tamivir from Tamiflu® capsules performs similar to oseltamivir </p>
<heading>phosphate in mice (Smee et al., 2010b). </heading>
<p>Viruses </p>
<p>Influenza A/MS-H275Y was obtained from the Neuraminidase </p>
<p>Inhibitor Surveillance Network (Melbourne, Australia). The virus </p>
<p>was passaged seven times in mice to enhance its virulence, then </p>
<p>once in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (purchased from </p>
<p>the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to in- </p>
<p>crease its titer. The virus was later titrated in BALB/c mice for </p>
<p>lethality. Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) was obtained </p>
<p>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>USA). Influenza A/HK-H275Y virus was provided by Kwok-Yung </p>
<p>Yuen, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administra- </p>
<p>tive Region, People’s Republic of China. This was one of the first re- </p>
<p>ported oseltamivir-resistant pandemic viruses (Chen et al., 2009). </p>
<p>The virus was adapted to mice by four sequential passages through </p>
<p>mouse lungs, followed by one passage in MDCK cells. For passag- </p>
<p>ing, BALB/c mice were infected with a 90-ll suspension of virus </p>
<p>at a 1:2 dilution of the previously derived virus pool, starting with </p>
<p>virus propagated in MDCK cells. Lungs were harvested from the </p>
<p>mice at three days post-infection, homogenized in cell culture </p>
<p>medium (MEM, one ml per lung) and frozen for subsequent pas- </p>
<p>sage in mice. </p>
<p>The mouse-adapted viruses were partially sequenced in the </p>
<p>neuraminidase gene and found to contain the H275Y mutation, </p>
<p>as did the parental viruses. No other genes were sequenced. </p>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay </p>
<p>MDCK cells in 96-well microplates were infected with approxi- </p>
<p>mately 50 cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) of virus. The med- </p>
<p>ium used for assays was MEM, 0.22% sodium bicarbonate, and </p>
<p>10 units/ml of trypsin. Compounds in half-log10 concentrations </p>
<p>were applied to cells 5–10 min prior to adding virus-containing </p>
<p>medium. Three microwells at each concentration of compound </p>
<p>were infected. Two microwells were uninfected and served as tox- </p>
<p>icity controls. After three days of incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, CPE </p>
<p>was quantified by neutral red dye uptake (Smee et al., 2001, 2002) </p>
<p>using the dye at a 0.011% final concentration for 2 h. Excess dye </p>
<p>was rinsed from cells with PBS. The absorbed dye was eluted from </p>
<p>the cells with 0.1 ml of 50% Sörensen’s citrate buffer (pH 4.2)/50% </p>
<p>ethanol. Plates were read for optical density determination at </p>
<p>560 nm. Readings were converted to percent of uninfected control </p>
<p>using an Excel spread sheet developed for this purpose. Fifty per- </p>
<p>cent virus-inhibitory concentrations (EC50 values) and 50% cyto- </p>
<p>toxic concentrations (CC50 values) were determined by plotting </p>
<p>percent CPE versus log10 of inhibitor concentration. Selectivity in- </p>
<p>dex (SI) values were calculated as CC50/EC50. </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition assay </p>
<p>The effects of compounds on viral neuraminidase activity were </p>
<p>determined using a commercially available kit (NA-Star® Influenza </p>
<p>Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit, from Applied </p>
<p>Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in 96-well opaque white micro- </p>
<p>plates following the manufacturer’s instructions and as has been </p>
<p>reported (Smee et al., 2010a). Compounds in half-log dilution </p>
<p>increments were incubated with virus (as the source of neuramin- </p>
<p>idase). The amount of virus in each microwell was approximately </p>
<p>500 CCID50 to achieve an adequate signal for assay quantitation. </p>
<p>Plates were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to addition of </p>
<p>chemiluminescent substrate. Following addition of substrate the </p>
<p>plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The neuraminidase </p>
<p>activity was evaluated using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Bert- </p>
<p>hold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) for 0.5 s immediately after </p>
<p>addition of NA-Star® accelerator solution. Fifty percent inhibitory </p>
<p>concentrations (IC50 values) were determined by plotting percent </p>
<p>chemiluminescent counts versus log10 inhibitor concentration. </p>
<p>Animal experiment design </p>
<p>Female BALB/c mice (18–20 g, Charles River Laboratories, Wil- </p>
<p>mington, MA, USA) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection </p>
<p>of ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg), followed by intranasal infec- </p>
<p>tion with a 90-ll suspension of influenza virus. The virus challenge </p>
<p>was approximately three 50% mouse lethal infectious doses and </p>
<p>equated to approximately 1–3 x 104 50% cell culture infectious </p>
<p>doses (CCID50) per mouse. Other investigators use lower (30– 50 </p>
<p>ll) volumes for virus challenge. A higher volume of inoculum </p>
<p>delivers more liquid to the lungs (Southam et al., 2002), which </p>
<p>we feel improves the consistency of infection. Treatments were gi- </p>
<p>ven twice a day (at 12 h intervals) for 5 days starting either 2 h be- </p>
<p>fore or 24 h after virus challenge. Parameters used to assess the </p>
<p>infection were survival and body weight changes. Animals were </p>
<p>weighed through day 14 of the infection. Animals that lost more </p>
<p>than 30% of their weight were euthanized (early euthanasia crite- </p>
<p>rion). There were 10 mice per antiviral compound dosage group. </p>
<p>Twenty placebo-treated mice were used in studies with amanta- </p>
<p>dine, oseltamivir, and ribavirin, whereas the rimantadine and </p>
<p>zanamivir experiments each had 15 placebos. </p>
<p>For one experiment the lungs from sacrificed mice were assayed </p>
<p>for virus titer. This was performed by harvesting the lungs (5 ani- </p>
<p>mals per group) on days 3 and 6 after infection. Lungs were </p>
<p>weighed, then frozen at 80 °C. Later, thawed lungs were homog- </p>
<p>enized and samples plated in quadruplicate on MDCK cell mono- </p>
<p>layers in 96-well microplates in 10-fold dilution increments. On </p>
<p>day 6 of the infection of cells, wells were observed microscopically </p>
<p>for the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. Endpoint dilution ti- </p>
<heading>! </heading>
<p>ters were calculated (Reed and Muench, 1938), and results con- </p>
<p>verted to log10 cell culture infectious doses per gram of tissue. </p>
<p>Statistical analysis of animal studies </p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared by </p>
<p>the Mantel-Cox log-rank test to determine statistical significance. </p>
<p>Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were made by the Gehan-Bre- </p>
<p>slow-Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni-corrected threshold for signif- </p>
<p>icance. Lung virus titers were analyzed by one-way ANOVA </p>
<p>followed by Neuman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. Pairwise </p>
<p>comparisons were made between drug-treated </p>
<p>and placebo </p>
<p>groups, and were analyzed using Prism® 5.0 software (GraphPad </p>
<p>Software, San Diego, CA). </p>
<p>Ethics statement for animal studies </p>
<p>The experiments were conducted in accordance with an ap- </p>
<p>proved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Commit- </p>
<p>tee of Utah State University. The work was performed in the </p>
<p>AAALAC-accredited Laboratory Animal Research Center of the uni- </p>
<p>versity in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide </p>
<p>for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Revision; 2010). </p>
<heading>3. Results </heading>
<p>Viral cytopathic effect inhibition studies </p>
<p>Six compounds representing different classes [viral M2 channel </p>
<p>blockers (Leonov et al., 2011): amantadine and rimantadine; viral </p>
<p>neuraminidase inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2010): oseltamivir car- </p>
<p>boxylate, peramivir, and zanamivir; and a viral polymerase inhib- </p>
<p>itor (Eriksson et al., 1977): ribavirin], were evaluated for anti- </p>
<p>influenza virus activity in cell culture against oseltamivir-sensitive </p>
<p>influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, and oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses (Table 1). </p>
<p>Against the sensitive virus, the three neuraminidase inhibitors </p>
<p>showed similar inhibitory activity of 0.04–0.08 lM, with ribavirin </p>
<p>activity at 28 lM, and amantadine and rimantadine showing no </p>
<p>antiviral effect. Against the H275Y viruses, oseltamivir carboxylate </p>
<p>was inactive at 100 lM, peramivir exhibited protection at about </p>
<p>8 lM, and zanamivir was inhibitory at 0.24–0.36 lM. Amantadine </p>
<p>and rimantadine were both highly active against A/MS-H275Y </p>
<p>(although rimantadine exhibited toxicity at 22 lM), but were not </p>
<p>active against A/HK-H275Y. Ribavirin was inhibitory at 25– 33 </p>
<p>lM. These values are comparable to the published values </p>
<p>against the non-mouse-adapted influenza A/MS-H275Y virus </p>

<p>Viral neuraminidase inhibition experiments </p>
<p>The three inhibitors of viral neuraminidase were tested for </p>
<p>inhibitory activity against one oseltamivir-sensitive and two osel- </p>
<p>tamivir-resistant (H275Y) viral neuraminidases (Table 2). Oseltam- </p>
<p>ivir carboxylate was ineffective against the two H275Y enzymes at </p>
<p>100 nM. Peramivir showed activity at 29–38 nM. Zanamivir was </p>
<p>highly active at 0.9–1 nM against the drug-resistant viruses. </p>
<p>Against the wild-type A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, all three </p>
<p>compounds were active, although oseltamivir carboxylate was </p>
<p>slightly less potent than the other two compounds. </p>
<p>Efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in infected mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and zanamivir were evaluated for efficacy against </p>
<p>influenza A/MS-H275Y virus infections in mice. Treatments were </p>
<p>initiated either 2 h prior to virus challenge or 24 h after infection. </p>
<p>In the 2 h infection, oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 </p>
<p>and 300 mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 30% and 60%, respec- </p>
<p>tively (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of oseltamivir were not active. When </p>
<p>treatment initiation time was delayed to +24 h, all doses of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir were ineffective (Fig. 1B). Treatment with zanamivir start- </p>
<p>ing at 2 h provided protection of 20%, 30%, 60%, and 90% at doses </p>
<p>of 3, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day (Fig. 1C). The 1-mg/kg/day dose of </p>
<p>zanamivir was ineffective. Considerably less activity was observed </p>
<p>for the +24 h treatments. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir de- </p>
<p>layed the time to death significantly but did little to prevent mor- </p>
<p>tality (Fig. 1D). Thus, neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir were able </p>
<p>to treat an established infection. </p>

<p>Amantadine and rimantadine were tested for their ability to </p>
<p>prevent or delay the time to death in mice challenged with the </p>
<p>A/MS-H275Y virus. Doses of amantadine (10–100 mg/kg/day) initi- </p>
<p>ated at 2 h were 80–100% protective (Fig. 2A), with no effect seen </p>
<p>at 3 mg/kg/day. Some activity was lost by delaying treatment to </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2B). The 30 and 100 mg/kg/day doses were 60% and </p>
<p>100% protective, respectively. No significant effect was seen at 3 </p>
<p>and 10 mg/kg/day compared to placebo. Rimantadine provided a </p>
<p>survival benefit at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, starting either at 2 or </p>
<p>+24 h (Fig. 2C and D), with no significant effect at 1 and 3 mg/kg/ </p>
<p>day. Survival observed was between 70% and 100%, although in </p>
<p>these experiments the placebo groups had a survival rate of 20%. </p>
<p>Both amantadine and rimantadine were able to treat the infection </p>
<p>after its onset. </p>

<p>Efficacy of ribavirin in infected mice </p>
<p>The protective activity of ribavirin was studied in mice infected </p>
<p>with influenza A/MS-H275Y virus. Treatment efficacy was similar </p>
<p>for treatments initiated either at 2h (Fig. 2E) or at +24 h </p>
<p>(Fig. 2F), although there were more survivors at 30 mg/kg/day in </p>
<p>the 2 h group (which was not statistically different from the </p>
<p>+24 h group). Ribavirin was not effective at 3 and 10 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>At the higher doses, ribavirin was capable of treating the infection </p>
<p>after it was initiated. </p>

<p>Efficacy of oseltamivir and ribavirin against influenza </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice </p>
<p>Oseltamivir and ribavirin were used to treat an A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infection starting treatment at 2 h relative to virus chal- </p>
<p>lenge (Fig. 3A). Oseltamivir was partially protective at 100 and 300 </p>
<p>mg/kg/day, with survival rates of 50% and 70%, respectively. </p>
<p>Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day were not significantly effective com- </p>
<p>pared to placebo. Ribavirin was fully protective at 75 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>These survival results for oseltamivir treatment were similar to </p>
<p>those obtained in treating the A/MS-H275Y virus infection </p>

<p>In this report we demonstrated that two different influenza A </p>

<p>weight change (B) during an influenza A/HK-H275Y virus infection in mice. Oral </p>
<p>gavage treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to </p>
<p>infection. The SD for weight change was ±10% or less. Values in parentheses are mg/ </p>
<p>kg/day doses. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, compared to placebo. </p>
<p>viruses possessing the H275Y mutation in the neuraminidase gene </p>
<p>could be mouse adapted to cause fatal infections in mice. The </p>
<p>H275Y mutation was stable during the mouse passages, as deter- </p>
<p>mined by genetic analysis of the relevant region of the neuramin- </p>
<p>idase gene. The viruses were also evaluated in cell culture and </p>
<p>neuraminidase assays to demonstrate that they were phenotypi- </p>
<p>cally resistant to oseltamivir. The mouse infection models were </p>
<p>then used to demonstrate antiviral activities of several known-ac- </p>
<p>tive antiviral agents. This is not the first time that antiviral studies </p>
<p>in mice were performed with oseltamivir-resistant viruses. The </p>
<p>first study that we are aware of was that of Baz et al. (2009) using </p>
<p>a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus. In that re- </p>
<p>port, they evaluated oseltamivir and a novel inhibitor, A322278. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir was only used up to 10 mg/kg/day, giving a mortality </p>
<p>rate of 75%. We used higher doses of the drug and saw survival </p>
<p>rates of 30–50% at 100 mg/kg/day and 60–70% at 300 mg/kg/day. </p>
<p>It is not known whether the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) H275Y virus re- </p>
<p>ported by Baz et al. (2009) would perform the same as our viruses </p>
<p>in infected mice if treated with higher doses of oseltamivir. This re- </p>
<p>port differs from that of Baz and colleagues in showing antiviral </p>
<p>activities of amantadine, rimantadine, ribavirin, and zanamivir, </p>
<p>which to our knowledge has never been shown before in a mouse </p>
<p>model of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection. </p>

<p>treatments were administered twice a day for 5 days starting 2 h prior to infection. The dotted line on each figure indicates the limit of virus detection. Virus titer units are log10 </p>

<p>The cell culture studies demonstrated that the A/MS-H275Y and </p>
<p>A/HK-H275Y viruses were resistant to oseltamivir, showed de- </p>
<p>creased sensitivity to peramivir, and were highly sensitive to </p>
<p>zanamivir. The A/MS-H275Y virus was also inhibited by amanta- </p>
<p>dine and rimantadine whereas the A/HK-H275Y was resistant to </p>
<p>the adamantanes. Ribavirin was the least potent in cell culture of </p>
<p>the compounds tested. The relative potencies identified for these </p>
<p>compounds in vitro are similar to published reports for oseltamivir </p>
<heading>(Smee et al., 2001), peramivir (Smee et al., 2001), zanamivir (Smee </heading>
<heading>et al., 2001), amantadine (Furuta et al., 2002), rimantadine (Valette </heading>
<heading>et al., 1993), and ribavirin (Selvam et al., 2010, 2006; Sleeman </heading>
<p>et al., 2010), against these or other wild-type influenza A (H1N1) </p>
<p>virus strains. Resistance of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses to </p>
<p>adamantanes has been previously described (Gubareva et al., </p>
<p>2010; Mossad, 2009), and is attributable to an S31N mutation in </p>
<p>the M2 gene. </p>
<p>Using a neuraminidase inhibition assay method, the relative </p>
<p>inhibitory concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, </p>
<p>and zanamivir compared well with published H1N1 virus results </p>
<heading>(Gubareva et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010a). Nguyen et al. </heading>
<p>(2010a) tested the same strain of influenza A/HK-H275Y virus that </p>
<p>we used with the NA-Star® assay, and reported IC50 values of 78, </p>
<p>9.2, and 0.43 lM for oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, and </p>
<p>zanamivir, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2010a). This compares to </p>
<p>our data of >100, 29, and 0.9 lM, respectively. The same pattern </p>
<p>of antiviral potency exhibited by the compounds (i.e., zanami- </p>
<p>vir > peramivir > oseltamivir) was evident for both the A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y viruses. This was not unexpected since </p>
<p>both viruses contain the same oseltamivir-resistance mutation. </p>
<p>The choice of doses used for animal studies was based largely </p>
<p>upon our previous experience in animal models, as well as antici- </p>
<p>pated outcomes based upon the cell culture and neuraminidase as- </p>
<p>say results. With oseltamivir, we wanted to administer high </p>
<p>enough doses to find activity. In our animal models we rarely ex- </p>
<p>ceed 300 mg/kg/day with any compound, since such high doses </p>
<p>in humans may not be tolerated. There are also problems with sol- </p>
<p>ubility, availability, and/or cost, depending upon the compound. </p>
<p>Zanamivir was administered only up to 100 mg/kg/day because it </p>
<p>showed better in vitro activity than oseltamivir carboxylate, and </p>
<p>it was expected to perform better than oseltamivir. Our experience </p>
<p>with amantadine indicated that it should be very effective at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day against the amantadine-sensitive virus (Smee </p>
<p>et al., 2009). We had no experience with rimantadine, but knew </p>
<p>from these studies that it was more potent but also more toxic than </p>
<p>amantadine, thus, the highest dose of 30 mg/kg/day was selected. </p>
<p>Finally, ribavirin was used at a high dose of 75 mg/kg/day because </p>
<p>many published studies indicated that this dose was highly protec- </p>
<heading>tive (Sidwell et al., 2005, 2001; Smee et al., 2004) as well as safe to </heading>
<p>administer. Ribavirin begins to cause toxicity in mice if used at </p>
<p>100 mg/kg/day. Significant antiviral activity was seen in mice trea- </p>
<p>ted with oseltamivir at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, although only up </p>
<p>to 60% protection. The 100-mg/kg/day dose of zanamivir (90% pro- </p>
<p>tective) proved to be more effective than oseltamivir at the same </p>
<p>dose. This is not surprising since the virus was oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant and zanamivir-sensitive. Amantadine’s 100% protective activ- </p>
<p>ity at the highest dose against the A/MS-H275Y virus infection was </p>
<p>similar to that seen previously (Smee et al., 2009). Lower doses of </p>
<p>rimantadine were as effective as the higher doses of amantadine, </p>
<p>which correlated with the in vitro potency of each compound. </p>
<p>The 75-mg/kg/day dose of ribavirin protected 90–100% of mice </p>
<p>from death. In addition, weight loss data for treatments were lar- </p>
<p>gely dose-responsive (Fig. 3B), as have been reported in other influ- </p>
<heading>enza virus infections (Bantia et al., 2010; Smee et al., 2010a). </heading>
<p>It has only been the more recent 2009 strains of oseltamivir- </p>
<p>resistant influenza virus that have been reported to be lethal to </p>
<p>mice (Hamelin et al., 2010). Prior to this, only the genetically engi- </p>
<p>neered A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) </p>
<p>H275Y viruses had been reported to lethally infect mice (Baz </p>
<heading>et al., 2009; Yen et al., 2007). In this report we indicate that the </heading>
<p>A/HK-H275Y 2009 virus described by Chen et al. (2009) could be </p>
<p>adapted for lethality in mice. In addition, we found the older A/ </p>
<p>MS-H275Y virus isolated in 2001 was also adapted and found </p>
<p>lethal to mice. The genetic changes acquired by these viruses dur- </p>
<p>ing mouse adaptation that make then lethal to mice are not pres- </p>
<p>ently known. The wild type neuraminidases for the A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>and A/MS-275Y viruses were sequenced and reported in GenBank. </p>
<p>An analysis of their sequences using the BLAST software available </p>
<p>on PubMed indicated 82% identical homology and 90% functional </p>
<p>homology (i.e., certain amino acid changes were not predicted to </p>
<p>dramatically alter the structure). Ilyushina and colleagues (2010) </p>
<p>reported five amino acid changes following adaptation of influenza </p>
<p>A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) wild-type virus to mice. These </p>
<p>changes were in PB2, HA and NP, with none in NA. One of the HA </p>
<p>mutations, D225G, was associated with increased virulence in mice </p>
<p>(Zheng et al., 2010). No other comparisons between influenza A/ </p>
<p>HK/2369/2009 (H1N1) and A/Mississippi/03/2001 (H1N1) viruses </p>
<p>could be made due to lack of sequence data for the latter virus. </p>
<p>Experimental data suggest that fitness of influenza viruses car- </p>
<p>rying neuraminidase mutations conferring drug resistance may </p>
<heading>differ (Baz et al., 2010; Herlocher et al., 2002; Yen et al., 2007, </heading>
<p>2005). Virulence in a mouse model may vary depending upon sev- </p>
<p>eral factors such as location of the mutation, virus genetic back- </p>
<p>D.F. Smee et al. / Antiviral Research 96 (2012) 13–20 </p>
<p>19 </p>
<p>ground, existence of permissive secondary neuraminidase muta- </p>
<p>tions, degree of neuraminidase functional loss, and an appropriate </p>
<p>balance between neuraminidase and hemagglutinin. This cannot </p>
<p>be determined in advance without going through the process of </p>
<p>mouse adaptation and lethality determinations, as was done for </p>
<p>the present studies. </p>
<p>Because antiviral protection was seen with oseltamivir at high </p>
<p>(100 and 300 mg/kg/day) doses in the mouse models of A/MS- </p>
<p>H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections, we are not suggesting </p>
<p>that this could translate into protection against oseltamivir-resis- </p>
<p>tant virus infections in humans. This is because the doses that were </p>
<p>used in mice exceed the approved human dose of oseltamivir. In </p>
<p>work performed at Adamas Pharmaceuticals (Nguyen et al., </p>
<p>2012) a dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice gave plasma levels of osel- </p>
<p>tamivir similar to that of humans. At this dose in mice, oseltamivir </p>
<p>provided no benefit against the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y </p>
<p>virus infections. In addition, the efficacy in mice was observed only </p>
<p>when the first treatment of oseltamivir was given prophylactically. </p>
<p>Patients will be initiating treatment after infection. An example of </p>
<p>this was a study of children infected with oseltamivir-resistant </p>
<p>influenza A H1N1 H275Y virus who showed reduced benefit from </p>
<p>treatment compared to children infected with sensitive virus (Saito </p>
<p>et al., 2010). Thus, our results in mice treated with low doses of </p>
<p>oseltamivir correlate with clinical findings. As a side note, ribavirin </p>
<p>at 27 mg/kg/day and amantadine at 46 mg/kg/day in mice gave </p>
<p>approximate human equivalent doses (Nguyen et al., 2012). In gen- </p>
<p>eral, a dose in mice is 12 times that of a human for equivalency, </p>
<p>based upon body surface area (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2007). </p>
<p>Delaying treatment by even one day is somewhat analogous to </p>
<p>infecting with virus at a higher multiplicity of infection, thus mak- </p>
<p>ing the infection more difficult to treat. Influenza virus strains vary </p>
<p>in their ability to be treated after the infection has been initiated. </p>
<p>Oseltamivir treatment of an influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus </p>
<p>infection [not to be confused with the A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus] </p>
<p>can be effective even when initiated up to three days after infection </p>
<p>(Sidwell et al., 1998). Treatment of influenza H3N2 and H5N1 virus </p>
<p>infections did not provide sufficient protection with even a one- </p>
<p>day delay of treatment initiation (Smee et al., 2010a, 2006), as oc- </p>
<p>curs with the A/MS-H275Y and A/HK-H275Y virus infections. We </p>
<p>have been investigating possible reasons for these differences but </p>
<p>have not yet come to any conclusions. Other researchers have </p>
<p>investigated differences among H5N1 virus strains in their ability </p>
<p>to be treated by oseltamivir (Govorkova et al., 2009). The investiga- </p>
<p>tors suggested that multiple factors can contribute to the efficacy </p>
<p>of neuraminidase inhibitors against highly pathogenic H5N1 influ- </p>
<p>enza viruses in vivo, such as virus virulence, virus neurotropic po- </p>
<p>tential, high levels of pulmonary expression of pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>chemokines and cytokines, and pre-existing minor populations of </p>
<p>drug-resistant clones. </p>
<p>Much work has been performed to evaluate compounds used in </p>
<p>combination (Govorkova and Webster, 2010), some of which in- </p>
<p>volved testing of drug-resistant viruses. However, these efforts </p>
<p>have primarily focused on using amantadine-resistant viruses that </p>
<p>are readily obtainable and many of which were easily mouse </p>
<heading>adapted (Ilyushina et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2009). From the results </heading>
<p>of these studies, the infection of mice with mouse-adapted influ- </p>
<p>enza A/MS-H275Y virus appears to represent a useful model for </p>
<p>studying the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant virus infections </p>
<p>with newly discovered antiviral substances and compounds used </p>
<p>in combination. The A/HK-H275Y model is also useful but we </p>
<p>found that variable mortality occurred from experiment to exper- </p>
<p>iment (the studies presented here were acceptable, but other unre- </p>
<p>ported experiments where we tested different inhibitors had too </p>
<p>few deaths in placebo groups for adequate statistical interpreta- </p>
<p>tion). Since the A/HK-H275Y virus is resistant to oseltamivir and </p>
<p>to adamantanes, it offers more limited possibilities for combina- </p>
<p>tion treatment than the A/MS-H275Y virus. The A/MS-H275Y virus </p>
<p>has already shown to be synergistically inhibited in vitro by the </p>
<p>combination of oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, and ribavirin </p>
<p>(Nguyen et al., 2010b). It will be important to investigate such </p>
<p>combinations in mouse models of oseltamivir-resistant virus </p>
<p>infection. </p>
