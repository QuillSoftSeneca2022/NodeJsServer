<heading>Abstract </heading>
The present state of emerging and re-emerging infections around the world has resulted in panic and confusion. The loss of 
lives due to these infections is huge. Also, the absence of clear guidelines and definitive treatment due to the paucity of literature 
has instilled fear among the general public. In this paper authors discuss some of these infectious diseases that have led to a state 
of complete chaos in the recent past.

<heading>Introduction </heading>
The developing countries are facing a number of 
issues related to public health. There are a growing 
number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among 
the lay public. The situation is so grave that the 
emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, 
swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason 
could well be attributed to the absence of clear 
management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is 
no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb 
these infections well before they could lead to large scale 
morbidity and mortality. The current situation is 
alarming and demands action, especially in developing 
countries where the major part of the population earns 
very less and the commitment from the annual budget 
towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. 
The present situation requires all the stakeholders, 
including the general public, government agencies, and 
private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, 
etc. to work in unison[4-6]. 
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola 
virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease 
characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its 
discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with 
many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the 
WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the 
breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. 
The disease has already created a situation of fear among 
the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports 
are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in 
countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge 
number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA 
approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation 
demands precautionary methods to be followed to 
prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. 
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report 
from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 
mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single 
stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The 
virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The 
paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice 
for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet 
infections. The population with conditions like chronic 
lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- 
compromised individuals are considered to be at high 
risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for 
this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, 
airborne infection control, including droplet control are 
some of the basics to be applied as advised by the 
WHO[10]. 
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st 
century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. 
The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza 
virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, 
swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- 
assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly

transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the 
transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion 
of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or 
coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork 
products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity 
and mortality and even today there is no effective 
preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come 
with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete 
chaos with large number of people suffering and 
ultimately the whole things stops when the summer 
season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge 
losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be 
prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine 
[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity 
which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for 
the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir 
(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 
hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are 
papers available in medical literature that has even 
questioned the safety and effectiveness of these 
drugs[12]. 
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an 
arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease 
was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and 
since then the same has been isolated in other primates 
and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an 
RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is 
transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The 
disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus 
found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into 
limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the 
fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as 
such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the 
situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother 
to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth 
defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings 
reported by the amniocentesis findings in the 
newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, 
semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. 
There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease 
and thus there is no definitive treatment options 
available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from 
mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and 
fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted 
countries have even requested the women to postpone 
pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines 
to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive 
research and is only based on the whatsoever cases 
available[22]. 
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
There is an urgent need to control the infections 
prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is 
extremely important as the new infections are emerging. 
The efforts should be made to develop definitive 
management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then 
there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity 
and mortality. 
The dissemination of healthcare information to all 
the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the 
extensive research into the various aspects of the 
aforementioned diseases is also imperative.

number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among 
the lay public. The situation is so grave that the 
emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, 
swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason 
could well be attributed to the absence of clear 
management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is 
no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb 
these infections well before they could lead to large scale 
morbidity and mortality. The current situation is 
alarming and demands action, especially in developing 
countries where the major part of the population earns 
very less and the commitment from the annual budget 
towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. 
The present situation requires all the stakeholders, 
including the general public, government agencies, and 
private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, 
etc. to work in unison[4-6]. 
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola 
virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease 
characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its 
discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with 
many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the 
WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the 
breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. 
The disease has already created a situation of fear among 
the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports 
are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in 
countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge 
number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA 
approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation 
demands precautionary methods to be followed to 
prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. 
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report 
from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 
mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single 
stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The 
virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The 
paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice 
for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet 
infections. The population with conditions like chronic 
lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- 
compromised individuals are considered to be at high 
risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for 
this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, 
airborne infection control, including droplet control are 
some of the basics to be applied as advised by the 
WHO[10]. 
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st 
century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. 
The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza 
virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, 
swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- 
assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly

transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the 
transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion 
of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or 
coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork 
products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity 
and mortality and even today there is no effective 
preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come 
with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete 
chaos with large number of people suffering and 
ultimately the whole things stops when the summer 
season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge 
losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be 
prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine 
[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity 
which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for 
the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir 
(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 
hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are 
papers available in medical literature that has even 
questioned the safety and effectiveness of these 
drugs[12]. 
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an 
arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease 
was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and 
since then the same has been isolated in other primates 
and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an 
RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is 
transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The 
disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus 
found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into 
limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the 
fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as 
such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the 
situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother 
to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth 
defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings 
reported by the amniocentesis findings in the 
newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, 
semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. 
There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease 
and thus there is no definitive treatment options 
available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from 
mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and 
fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted 
countries have even requested the women to postpone 
pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines 
to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive 
research and is only based on the whatsoever cases 
available[22]. 
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
There is an urgent need to control the infections 
prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is 
extremely important as the new infections are emerging. 
The efforts should be made to develop definitive 
management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then 
there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity 
and mortality. 
The dissemination of healthcare information to all 
the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the 
extensive research into the various aspects of the 
aforementioned diseases is also imperative.

The present state of emerging and re-emerging infections around the world has resulted in panic and confusion. The loss of 
lives due to these infections is huge. Also, the absence of clear guidelines and definitive treatment due to the paucity of literature 
has instilled fear among the general public. In this paper authors discuss some of these infectious diseases that have led to a state 
of complete chaos in the recent past.

number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA 
approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation 
demands precautionary methods to be followed to 
prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. 
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report 
from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 
mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single 
stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The 
virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The 
paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice 
for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet 
infections. The population with conditions like chronic 
lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- 
compromised individuals are considered to be at high 
risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for 
this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, 
airborne infection control, including droplet control are 
some of the basics to be applied as advised by the 
WHO[10]. 
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st 
century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. 
The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza 
virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, 
swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- 
assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly

transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the 
transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion 
of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or 
coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork 
products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity 
and mortality and even today there is no effective 
preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come 
with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete 
chaos with large number of people suffering and 
ultimately the whole things stops when the summer 
season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge 
losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be 
prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine 
[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity 
which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for 
the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir 
(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 
hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are 
papers available in medical literature that has even 
questioned the safety and effectiveness of these 
drugs[12]. 
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an 
arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease 
was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and 
since then the same has been isolated in other primates 
and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an 
RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is 
transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The 
disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus 
found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into 
limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the 
fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as 
such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the 
situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother 
to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth 
defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings 
reported by the amniocentesis findings in the 
newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, 
semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. 
There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease 
and thus there is no definitive treatment options 
available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from 
mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and 
fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted 
countries have even requested the women to postpone 
pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines 
to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive 
research and is only based on the whatsoever cases 
available[22]. 
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
There is an urgent need to control the infections 
prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is 
extremely important as the new infections are emerging. 
The efforts should be made to develop definitive 
management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then 
there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity 
and mortality. 
The dissemination of healthcare information to all 
the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the 
extensive research into the various aspects of the 
aforementioned diseases is also imperative.

<heading>Abstract </heading>
The present state of emerging and re-emerging infections around the world has resulted in panic and confusion. The loss of 
lives due to these infections is huge. Also, the absence of clear guidelines and definitive treatment due to the paucity of literature 
has instilled fear among the general public. In this paper authors discuss some of these infectious diseases that have led to a state 
of complete chaos in the recent past.

<heading>Introduction </heading>
The developing countries are facing a number of 
issues related to public health. There are a growing 
number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among 
the lay public. The situation is so grave that the 
emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, 
swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason 
could well be attributed to the absence of clear 
management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is 
no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb 
these infections well before they could lead to large scale 
morbidity and mortality. The current situation is 
alarming and demands action, especially in developing 
countries where the major part of the population earns 
very less and the commitment from the annual budget 
towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. 
The present situation requires all the stakeholders, 
including the general public, government agencies, and 
private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, 
etc. to work in unison[4-6]. 
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola 
virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease 
characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its 
discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with 
many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the 
WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the 
breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. 
The disease has already created a situation of fear among 
the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports 
are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in 
countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge 
number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA 
approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation 
demands precautionary methods to be followed to 
prevent the transmission of this deadly disease.

The present state of emerging and re-emerging infections around the world has resulted in panic and confusion. The loss of 
lives due to these infections is huge. Also, the absence of clear guidelines and definitive treatment due to the paucity of literature 
has instilled fear among the general public. In this paper authors discuss some of these infectious diseases that have led to a state 
of complete chaos in the recent past.

<title>Introduction </title>
The developing countries are facing a number of 
issues related to public health. There are a growing 
number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among 
the lay public. The situation is so grave that the 
emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, 
swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason 
could well be attributed to the absence of clear 
management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is 
no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb 
these infections well before they could lead to large scale 
morbidity and mortality. The current situation is 
alarming and demands action, especially in developing 
countries where the major part of the population earns 
very less and the commitment from the annual budget 
towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. 
The present situation requires all the stakeholders, 
including the general public, government agencies, and 
private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, 
etc. to work in unison[4-6]. 
<title>Ebola virus disease </title>
The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola 
virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease 
characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its 
discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with 
many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the 
WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the 
breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. 
The disease has already created a situation of fear among 
the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports 
are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in 
countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge 
number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA 
approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation 
demands precautionary methods to be followed to 
prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. 
<title>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </title>
<title>(MERS-CoV) infection </title>
The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report 
from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 
mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single 
stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The 
virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The 
paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice 
for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet 
infections. The population with conditions like chronic 
lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- 
compromised individuals are considered to be at high 
risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for 
this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, 
airborne infection control, including droplet control are 
some of the basics to be applied as advised by the 
WHO[10]. 
<title>Swine influenza/ flu </title>
The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st 
century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. 
The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza 
virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, 
swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- 
assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly

transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the 
transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion 
of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or 
coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork 
products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity 
and mortality and even today there is no effective 
preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come 
with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete 
chaos with large number of people suffering and 
ultimately the whole things stops when the summer 
season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge 
losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be 
prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine 
[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity 
which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for 
the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir 
(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 
hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are 
papers available in medical literature that has even 
questioned the safety and effectiveness of these 
drugs[12]. 
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an 
arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease 
was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and 
since then the same has been isolated in other primates 
and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an 
RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is 
transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The 
disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus 
found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into 
limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the 
fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as 
such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the 
situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother 
to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth 
defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings 
reported by the amniocentesis findings in the 
newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, 
semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. 
There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease 
and thus there is no definitive treatment options 
available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from 
mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and 
fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted 
countries have even requested the women to postpone 
pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines 
to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive 
research and is only based on the whatsoever cases 
available[22]. 
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
There is an urgent need to control the infections 
prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is 
extremely important as the new infections are emerging. 
The efforts should be made to develop definitive 
management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then 
there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity 
and mortality. 
The dissemination of healthcare information to all 
the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the 
extensive research into the various aspects of the 
aforementioned diseases is also imperative.

transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the 
transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion 
of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or 
coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork 
products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity 
and mortality and even today there is no effective 
preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come 
with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete 
chaos with large number of people suffering and 
ultimately the whole things stops when the summer 
season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge 
losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be 
prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine 
[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity 
which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for 
the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir 
(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 
hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are 
papers available in medical literature that has even 
questioned the safety and effectiveness of these 
drugs[12]. 
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an 
arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease 
was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and 
since then the same has been isolated in other primates 
and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an 
RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is 
transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The 
disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus 
found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into 
limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the 
fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as 
such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the 
situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother 
to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth 
defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings 
reported by the amniocentesis findings in the 
newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, 
semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. 
There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease 
and thus there is no definitive treatment options 
available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from 
mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and 
fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted 
countries have even requested the women to postpone 
pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines 
to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive 
research and is only based on the whatsoever cases 
available[22]. 
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
There is an urgent need to control the infections 
prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is 
extremely important as the new infections are emerging. 
The efforts should be made to develop definitive 
management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then 
there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity 
and mortality. 
The dissemination of healthcare information to all 
the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the 
extensive research into the various aspects of the 
aforementioned diseases is also imperative.

transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the 
transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion 
of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or 
coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork 
products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity 
and mortality and even today there is no effective 
preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come 
with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete 
chaos with large number of people suffering and 
ultimately the whole things stops when the summer 
season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge 
losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be 
prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine 
[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity 
which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for 
the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir 
(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 
hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are 
papers available in medical literature that has even 
questioned the safety and effectiveness of these 
drugs[12]. 
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an 
arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease 
was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and 
since then the same has been isolated in other primates 
and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an 
RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is 
transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The 
disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus 
found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into 
limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the 
fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as 
such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the 
situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother 
to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth 
defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings 
reported by the amniocentesis findings in the 
newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, 
semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. 
There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease 
and thus there is no definitive treatment options 
available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from 
mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and 
fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted 
countries have even requested the women to postpone 
pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines 
to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive 
research and is only based on the whatsoever cases 
available[22]. 
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
There is an urgent need to control the infections 
prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is 
extremely important as the new infections are emerging. 
The efforts should be made to develop definitive 
management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then 
there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity 
and mortality. 
The dissemination of healthcare information to all 
the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the 
extensive research into the various aspects of the 
aforementioned diseases is also imperative.

<title>Abstract </title>
The present state of emerging and re-emerging infections around the world has resulted in panic and confusion. The loss of 
lives due to these infections is huge. Also, the absence of clear guidelines and definitive treatment due to the paucity of literature 
has instilled fear among the general public. In this paper authors discuss some of these infectious diseases that have led to a state 
of complete chaos in the recent past.

<heading>Introduction </heading>
The developing countries are facing a number of 
issues related to public health. There are a growing 
number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among 
the lay public. The situation is so grave that the 
emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, 
swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason 
could well be attributed to the absence of clear 
management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is 
no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb 
these infections well before they could lead to large scale 
morbidity and mortality. The current situation is 
alarming and demands action, especially in developing 
countries where the major part of the population earns 
very less and the commitment from the annual budget 
towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. 
The present situation requires all the stakeholders, 
including the general public, government agencies, and 
private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, 
etc. to work in unison[4-6]. 
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola 
virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease 
characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its 
discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with 
many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the 
WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the 
breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. 
The disease has already created a situation of fear among 
the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports 
are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in 
countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge 
number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA 
approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation 
demands precautionary methods to be followed to 
prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. 
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report 
from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 
mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single 
stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The 
virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The 
paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice 
for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet 
infections. The population with conditions like chronic 
lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- 
compromised individuals are considered to be at high 
risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for 
this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, 
airborne infection control, including droplet control are 
some of the basics to be applied as advised by the 
WHO[10]. 
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st 
century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11].

hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are 
papers available in medical literature that has even 
questioned the safety and effectiveness of these 
drugs[12]. 
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an 
arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease 
was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and 
since then the same has been isolated in other primates 
and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an 
RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is 
transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The 
disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus 
found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into 
limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the 
fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as 
such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the 
situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother 
to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth 
defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings 
reported by the amniocentesis findings in the 
newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, 
semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. 
There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease 
and thus there is no definitive treatment options 
available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from 
mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and 
fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted 
countries have even requested the women to postpone 
pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines 
to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive 
research and is only based on the whatsoever cases 
available[22]. 
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
There is an urgent need to control the infections 
prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is 
extremely important as the new infections are emerging. 
The efforts should be made to develop definitive 
management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then 
there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity 
and mortality. 
The dissemination of healthcare information to all 
the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the 
extensive research into the various aspects of the 
aforementioned diseases is also imperative.

<heading>Abstract </heading>
The present state of emerging and re-emerging infections around the world has resulted in panic and confusion. The loss of 
lives due to these infections is huge. Also, the absence of clear guidelines and definitive treatment due to the paucity of literature 
has instilled fear among the general public. In this paper authors discuss some of these infectious diseases that have led to a state 
of complete chaos in the recent past.

<heading>Introduction </heading>
The developing countries are facing a number of 
issues related to public health. There are a growing 
number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among 
the lay public. The situation is so grave that the 
emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, 
swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason 
could well be attributed to the absence of clear 
management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is 
no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb 
these infections well before they could lead to large scale 
morbidity and mortality. The current situation is 
alarming and demands action, especially in developing 
countries where the major part of the population earns 
very less and the commitment from the annual budget 
towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. 
The present situation requires all the stakeholders, 
including the general public, government agencies, and 
private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, 
etc. to work in unison[4-6]. 
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola 
virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease 
characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its 
discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with 
many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the 
WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the 
breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. 
The disease has already created a situation of fear among 
the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports 
are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in 
countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge 
number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA 
approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation 
demands precautionary methods to be followed to 
prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. 
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report 
from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 
mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single 
stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The 
virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The 
paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice 
for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet 
infections. The population with conditions like chronic 
lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- 
compromised individuals are considered to be at high 
risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for 
this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, 
airborne infection control, including droplet control are 
some of the basics to be applied as advised by the 
WHO[10]. 
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st 
century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. 
The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza 
virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, 
swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- 
assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly

transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the 
transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion 
of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or 
coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork 
products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity 
and mortality and even today there is no effective 
preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come 
with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete 
chaos with large number of people suffering and 
ultimately the whole things stops when the summer 
season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge 
losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be 
prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine 
[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity 
which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for 
the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir 
(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 
hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are 
papers available in medical literature that has even 
questioned the safety and effectiveness of these 
drugs[12].

<p>losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be </p>
<p>prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine </p>
<p>[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity </p>
<p>which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for </p>
<p>the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir </p>
<p>(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 </p>
<p>hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are </p>
<p>papers available in medical literature that has even </p>
<p>questioned the safety and effectiveness of these </p>
<p>drugs[12]. </p>
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
<p>The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an </p>
<p>arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease </p>
<p>was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and </p>
<p>since then the same has been isolated in other primates </p>
<p>and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an </p>
<p>RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is </p>
<p>transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The </p>
<p>disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus </p>
<p>found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into </p>
<p>limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the </p>
<p>fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as </p>
<p>such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the </p>
<p>situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother </p>
<p>to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth </p>
<p>defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings </p>
<p>reported by the amniocentesis findings in the </p>
<p>newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, </p>
<p>semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. </p>
<p>There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease </p>
<p>and thus there is no definitive treatment options </p>
<p>available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from </p>
<p>mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and </p>
<p>fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted </p>
<p>countries have even requested the women to postpone </p>
<p>pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines </p>
<p>to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive </p>
<p>research and is only based on the whatsoever cases </p>
<p>available[22]. </p>
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
<p>There is an urgent need to control the infections </p>
<p>prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is </p>
<p>extremely important as the new infections are emerging. </p>
<p>The efforts should be made to develop definitive </p>
<p>management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then </p>
<p>there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality. </p>
<p>The dissemination of healthcare information to all </p>
<p>the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the </p>
<p>extensive research into the various aspects of the </p>
<p>aforementioned diseases is also imperative. </p>

<heading>Introduction </heading>
<p>The developing countries are facing a number of </p>
<p>issues related to public health. There are a growing </p>
<p>number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among </p>
<p>the lay public. The situation is so grave that the </p>
<p>emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, </p>
<p>swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason </p>
<p>could well be attributed to the absence of clear </p>
<p>management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is </p>
<p>no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb </p>
<p>these infections well before they could lead to large scale </p>
<p>morbidity and mortality. The current situation is </p>
<p>alarming and demands action, especially in developing </p>
<p>countries where the major part of the population earns </p>
<p>very less and the commitment from the annual budget </p>
<p>towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. </p>
<p>The present situation requires all the stakeholders, </p>
<p>including the general public, government agencies, and </p>
<p>private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, </p>
<p>etc. to work in unison[4-6]. </p>
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
<p>The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola </p>
<p>virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease </p>
<p>characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its </p>
<p>discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with </p>
<p>many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the </p>
<p>WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the </p>
<p>breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. </p>
<p>The disease has already created a situation of fear among </p>
<p>the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports </p>
<p>are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in </p>
<p>countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge </p>
<p>number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA </p>
<p>approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation </p>
<p>demands precautionary methods to be followed to </p>
<p>prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. </p>
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
<p>The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report </p>
<p>from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 </p>
<p>mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single </p>
<p>stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The </p>
<p>virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The </p>
<p>paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice </p>
<p>for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet </p>
<p>infections. The population with conditions like chronic </p>
<p>lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- </p>
<p>compromised individuals are considered to be at high </p>
<p>risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for </p>
<p>this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, </p>
<p>airborne infection control, including droplet control are </p>
<p>some of the basics to be applied as advised by the </p>
<p>WHO[10]. </p>
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
<p>The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st </p>
<p>century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. </p>
<p>The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza </p>
<p>virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, </p>
<p>swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- </p>
<p>assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly </p>

<p>transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the </p>
<p>transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion </p>
<p>of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or </p>
<p>coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork </p>
<p>products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality and even today there is no effective </p>
<p>preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come </p>
<p>with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete </p>
<p>chaos with large number of people suffering and </p>
<p>ultimately the whole things stops when the summer </p>
<p>season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge </p>

<heading>Introduction </heading>
<p>The developing countries are facing a number of </p>
<p>issues related to public health. There are a growing </p>
<p>number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among </p>
<p>the lay public. The situation is so grave that the </p>
<p>emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, </p>
<p>swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason </p>
<p>could well be attributed to the absence of clear </p>
<p>management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is </p>
<p>no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb </p>
<p>these infections well before they could lead to large scale </p>
<p>morbidity and mortality. The current situation is </p>
<p>alarming and demands action, especially in developing </p>
<p>countries where the major part of the population earns </p>
<p>very less and the commitment from the annual budget </p>
<p>towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. </p>
<p>The present situation requires all the stakeholders, </p>
<p>including the general public, government agencies, and </p>
<p>private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, </p>
<p>etc. to work in unison[4-6]. </p>
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
<p>The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola </p>
<p>virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease </p>
<p>characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its </p>
<p>discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with </p>
<p>many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the </p>
<p>WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the </p>
<p>breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. </p>
<p>The disease has already created a situation of fear among </p>
<p>the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports </p>
<p>are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in </p>
<p>countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge </p>
<p>number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA </p>
<p>approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation </p>
<p>demands precautionary methods to be followed to </p>
<p>prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. </p>
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
<p>The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report </p>
<p>from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 </p>
<p>mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single </p>
<p>stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The </p>
<p>virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The </p>
<p>paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice </p>
<p>for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet </p>
<p>infections. The population with conditions like chronic </p>
<p>lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- </p>
<p>compromised individuals are considered to be at high </p>
<p>risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for </p>
<p>this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, </p>
<p>airborne infection control, including droplet control are </p>
<p>some of the basics to be applied as advised by the </p>
<p>WHO[10]. </p>
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
<p>The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st </p>
<p>century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. </p>
<p>The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza </p>
<p>virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, </p>
<p>swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- </p>
<p>assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly </p>

<p>transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the </p>
<p>transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion </p>
<p>of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or </p>
<p>coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork </p>
<p>products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality and even today there is no effective </p>
<p>preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come </p>
<p>with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete </p>
<p>chaos with large number of people suffering and </p>
<p>ultimately the whole things stops when the summer </p>
<p>season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge </p>
<p>losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be </p>
<p>prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine </p>
<p>[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity </p>
<p>which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for </p>
<p>the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir </p>
<p>(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 </p>
<p>hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are </p>
<p>papers available in medical literature that has even </p>
<p>questioned the safety and effectiveness of these </p>
<p>drugs[12]. </p>
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
<p>The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an </p>
<p>arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease </p>
<p>was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and </p>
<p>since then the same has been isolated in other primates </p>
<p>and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an </p>
<p>RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is </p>
<p>transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The </p>
<p>disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus </p>
<p>found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into </p>
<p>limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the </p>
<p>fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as </p>
<p>such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the </p>
<p>situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother </p>
<p>to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth </p>
<p>defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings </p>
<p>reported by the amniocentesis findings in the </p>
<p>newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, </p>
<p>semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. </p>
<p>There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease </p>
<p>and thus there is no definitive treatment options </p>
<p>available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from </p>
<p>mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and </p>
<p>fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted </p>
<p>countries have even requested the women to postpone </p>
<p>pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines </p>
<p>to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive </p>
<p>research and is only based on the whatsoever cases </p>
<p>available[22]. </p>
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
<p>There is an urgent need to control the infections </p>
<p>prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is </p>
<p>extremely important as the new infections are emerging. </p>
<p>The efforts should be made to develop definitive </p>
<p>management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then </p>
<p>there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality. </p>
<p>The dissemination of healthcare information to all </p>
<p>the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the </p>
<p>extensive research into the various aspects of the </p>
<p>aforementioned diseases is also imperative. </p>

<heading>Introduction </heading>
<p>The developing countries are facing a number of </p>
<p>issues related to public health. There are a growing </p>
<p>number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among </p>
<p>the lay public. The situation is so grave that the </p>
<p>emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, </p>
<p>swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason </p>
<p>could well be attributed to the absence of clear </p>
<p>management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is </p>
<p>no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb </p>
<p>these infections well before they could lead to large scale </p>
<p>morbidity and mortality. The current situation is </p>
<p>alarming and demands action, especially in developing </p>
<p>countries where the major part of the population earns </p>
<p>very less and the commitment from the annual budget </p>
<p>towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. </p>
<p>The present situation requires all the stakeholders, </p>
<p>including the general public, government agencies, and </p>
<p>private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, </p>
<p>etc. to work in unison[4-6]. </p>
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
<p>The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola </p>
<p>virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease </p>
<p>characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its </p>
<p>discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with </p>
<p>many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the </p>
<p>WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the </p>
<p>breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. </p>
<p>The disease has already created a situation of fear among </p>
<p>the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports </p>
<p>are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in </p>
<p>countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge </p>
<p>number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA </p>
<p>approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation </p>
<p>demands precautionary methods to be followed to </p>
<p>prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. </p>
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
<p>The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report </p>
<p>from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 </p>
<p>mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single </p>
<p>stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The </p>
<p>virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The </p>
<p>paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice </p>
<p>for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet </p>
<p>infections. The population with conditions like chronic </p>
<p>lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- </p>
<p>compromised individuals are considered to be at high </p>
<p>risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for </p>
<p>this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, </p>
<p>airborne infection control, including droplet control are </p>
<p>some of the basics to be applied as advised by the </p>
<p>WHO[10]. </p>
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
<p>The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st </p>
<p>century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. </p>
<p>The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza </p>
<p>virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, </p>
<p>swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- </p>
<p>assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly </p>

<p>transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the </p>
<p>transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion </p>
<p>of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or </p>
<p>coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork </p>
<p>products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality and even today there is no effective </p>
<p>preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come </p>
<p>with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete </p>
<p>chaos with large number of people suffering and </p>
<p>ultimately the whole things stops when the summer </p>
<p>season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge </p>
<p>losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be </p>
<p>prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine </p>
<p>[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity </p>
<p>which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for </p>
<p>the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir </p>
<p>(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 </p>
<p>hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are </p>
<p>papers available in medical literature that has even </p>
<p>questioned the safety and effectiveness of these </p>
<p>drugs[12]. </p>
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
<p>The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an </p>
<p>arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease </p>
<p>was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and </p>
<p>since then the same has been isolated in other primates </p>
<p>and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an </p>
<p>RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is </p>
<p>transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The </p>
<p>disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus </p>
<p>found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into </p>
<p>limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the </p>
<p>fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as </p>
<p>such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the </p>
<p>situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother </p>
<p>to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth </p>
<p>defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings </p>
<p>reported by the amniocentesis findings in the </p>
<p>newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, </p>
<p>semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. </p>
<p>There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease </p>
<p>and thus there is no definitive treatment options </p>
<p>available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from </p>
<p>mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and </p>
<p>fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted </p>
<p>countries have even requested the women to postpone </p>
<p>pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines </p>
<p>to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive </p>
<p>research and is only based on the whatsoever cases </p>
<p>available[22]. </p>
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
<p>There is an urgent need to control the infections </p>
<p>prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is </p>
<p>extremely important as the new infections are emerging. </p>
<p>The efforts should be made to develop definitive </p>
<p>management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then </p>
<p>there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality. </p>
<p>The dissemination of healthcare information to all </p>
<p>the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the </p>
<p>extensive research into the various aspects of the </p>
<p>aforementioned diseases is also imperative. </p>

<p>transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the </p>
<p>transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion </p>
<p>of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or </p>
<p>coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork </p>
<p>products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality and even today there is no effective </p>
<p>preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come </p>
<p>with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete </p>
<p>chaos with large number of people suffering and </p>
<p>ultimately the whole things stops when the summer </p>
<p>season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge </p>
<p>losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be </p>
<p>prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine </p>
<p>[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity </p>
<p>which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for </p>
<p>the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir </p>
<p>(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 </p>
<p>hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are </p>
<p>papers available in medical literature that has even </p>
<p>questioned the safety and effectiveness of these </p>
<p>drugs[12]. </p>
<heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
<p>The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an </p>
<p>arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease </p>
<p>was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and </p>
<p>since then the same has been isolated in other primates </p>
<p>and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an </p>
<p>RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is </p>
<p>transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The </p>
<p>disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus </p>
<p>found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into </p>
<p>limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the </p>
<p>fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as </p>
<p>such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the </p>
<p>situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother </p>
<p>to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth </p>
<p>defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings </p>
<p>reported by the amniocentesis findings in the </p>
<p>newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, </p>
<p>semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. </p>
<p>There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease </p>
<p>and thus there is no definitive treatment options </p>
<p>available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from </p>
<p>mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and </p>
<p>fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted </p>
<p>countries have even requested the women to postpone </p>
<p>pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines </p>
<p>to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive </p>
<p>research and is only based on the whatsoever cases </p>
<p>available[22]. </p>
<heading>Conclusions </heading>
<p>There is an urgent need to control the infections </p>
<p>prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is </p>
<p>extremely important as the new infections are emerging. </p>
<p>The efforts should be made to develop definitive </p>
<p>management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then </p>
<p>there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality. </p>
<p>The dissemination of healthcare information to all </p>
<p>the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the </p>
<p>extensive research into the various aspects of the </p>
<p>aforementioned diseases is also imperative. </p>

<heading>Introduction </heading>
<p>The developing countries are facing a number of </p>
<p>issues related to public health. There are a growing </p>
<p>number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among </p>
<p>the lay public. The situation is so grave that the </p>
<p>emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, </p>
<p>swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason </p>
<p>could well be attributed to the absence of clear </p>
<p>management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is </p>
<p>no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb </p>
<p>these infections well before they could lead to large scale </p>
<p>morbidity and mortality. The current situation is </p>
<p>alarming and demands action, especially in developing </p>
<p>countries where the major part of the population earns </p>
<p>very less and the commitment from the annual budget </p>
<p>towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. </p>
<p>The present situation requires all the stakeholders, </p>
<p>including the general public, government agencies, and </p>
<p>private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, </p>
<p>etc. to work in unison[4-6]. </p>
<heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
<p>The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola </p>
<p>virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease </p>
<p>characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its </p>
<p>discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with </p>
<p>many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the </p>
<p>WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the </p>
<p>breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. </p>
<p>The disease has already created a situation of fear among </p>
<p>the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports </p>
<p>are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in </p>
<p>countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge </p>
<p>number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA </p>
<p>approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation </p>
<p>demands precautionary methods to be followed to </p>
<p>prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. </p>
<heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
<p>The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report </p>
<p>from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 </p>
<p>mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single </p>
<p>stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The </p>
<p>virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The </p>
<p>paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice </p>
<p>for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet </p>
<p>infections. The population with conditions like chronic </p>
<p>lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- </p>
<p>compromised individuals are considered to be at high </p>
<p>risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for </p>
<p>this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, </p>
<p>airborne infection control, including droplet control are </p>
<p>some of the basics to be applied as advised by the </p>
<p>WHO[10]. </p>
<heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
<p>The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st </p>
<p>century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. </p>
<p>The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza </p>
<p>virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, </p>
<p>swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- </p>
<p>assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly </p>

</section><heading>Introduction </heading>
<p>The developing countries are facing a number of </p>
<p>issues related to public health. There are a growing </p>
<p>number of diseases that has led to panic and fear among </p>
<p>the lay public. The situation is so grave that the </p>
<p>emergence of certain diseases like Zika virus disease, </p>
<p>swine influenza has resulted in total chaos. The reason </p>
<p>could well be attributed to the absence of clear </p>
<p>management guidelines for these diseases. Also, there is </p>
<p>no preventive algorithm which could be followed to curb </p>
<p>these infections well before they could lead to large scale </p>
<p>morbidity and mortality. The current situation is </p>
<p>alarming and demands action, especially in developing </p>
<p>countries where the major part of the population earns </p>
<p>very less and the commitment from the annual budget </p>
<p>towards the health of the citizen is not substantial[1-3]. </p>
<p>The present situation requires all the stakeholders, </p>
<p>including the general public, government agencies, and </p>
<p>private agencies, including the NGO's like HIFA2015, </p>
<p>etc. to work in unison[4-6]. </p>
</section><heading>Ebola virus disease </heading>
<p>The West Africa has been flattened by the Ebola </p>
<p>virus[7]. The Ebola virus causes Ebola virus disease </p>
<p>characterized by hemorrhagic fever[7]. And since its </p>
<p>discovery in 1976 has claimed millions of lives with </p>
<p>many still suffering[7]. The recent reports from the </p>
<p>WHO shows the presence of the Ebola virus RNA in the </p>
<p>breast milk of affected mothers even after 16 months[8]. </p>
<p>The disease has already created a situation of fear among </p>
<p>the survivors and thus in this context the recent reports </p>
<p>are gruesome. The disease has led to devastation in </p>
<p>countries where HIV-AIDS has already claimed huge </p>
<p>number of lives. As per the CDC, there is no FDA </p>
<p>approved vaccine for Ebola virus[9]. Thus the situation </p>
<p>demands precautionary methods to be followed to </p>
<p>prevent the transmission of this deadly disease. </p>
</section><heading>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus </heading>
<heading>(MERS-CoV) infection </heading>
<p>The MERS-CoV came into limelight with a report </p>
<p>from the WHO about 1599 lab confirmed cases with 574 </p>
<p>mortalities[10]. The disease is caused by a single </p>
<p>stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacorona virus. The </p>
<p>virus has been found in bats, camels and humans. The </p>
<p>paucity of literature has forced the authorities to advice </p>
<p>for practicing utmost hygiene with control over droplet </p>
<p>infections. The population with conditions like chronic </p>
<p>lung disease, diabetes, renal failure, and immune- </p>
<p>compromised individuals are considered to be at high </p>
<p>risk[10]. There is no definitive treatment available for </p>
<p>this infection and thus the precautions like hand washing, </p>
<p>airborne infection control, including droplet control are </p>
<p>some of the basics to be applied as advised by the </p>
<p>WHO[10]. </p>
</section><heading>Swine influenza/ flu </heading>
<p>The WHO declared the first pandemic of the 21st </p>
<p>century in the year 2009, and it was swine influenza[11]. </p>
<p>The present circulating strain of swine origin influenza </p>
<p>virus of the H1N1 strain contains genes from the avian, </p>
<p>swine and human viruses and has undergone triple re- </p>
<p>assortment[11]. Swine influenza is a highly </p>

<p>transmissible acute respiratory disease of the pigs and the </p>
<p>transmission in humans occurs by inhalation or ingestion </p>
<p>of droplets containing viruses from people sneezing or </p>
<p>coughing; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork </p>
<p>products[2]. The disease has led to massive morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality and even today there is no effective </p>
<p>preparedness plan from the disease[2]. The winters come </p>
<p>with a news of swine flu cases followed by complete </p>
<p>chaos with large number of people suffering and </p>
<p>ultimately the whole things stops when the summer </p>
<p>season comes[2]. The lack of preparedness leads to huge </p>
<p>losses of life[2]. The only way the disease can be </p>
<p>prevented is by immunizing with the influenza vaccine </p>
<p>[11]. But the vaccine takes time to boost the immunity </p>
<p>which last only for a year thus there is no radical cure for </p>
<p>the disease[2]. The role of antiviral drugs like Zanamivir </p>
<p>(Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), if taken within 48 </p>
<p>hours is said to be effective[2,11]. However, there are </p>
<p>papers available in medical literature that has even </p>
<p>questioned the safety and effectiveness of these </p>
<p>drugs[12]. </p>
</section><heading>Zika virus disease </heading>
<p>The disease is caused by a flavivirus which is an </p>
<p>arbovirus belonging to Flaviviridae[13-16]. The disease </p>
<p>was first isolated from Uganda in a rhesus monkey and </p>
<p>since then the same has been isolated in other primates </p>
<p>and even in humans[17]. The disease is caused by an </p>
<p>RNA virus called as Zika virus (ZIKV) and is </p>
<p>transmitted by infected Anopheles species[17]. The </p>
<p>disease is actually a reemergence of an obscure virus </p>
<p>found in the equatorial region[17]. The ZIKV came into </p>
<p>limelight with the outbreak of manifold increase in the </p>
<p>fetal birth defects notably microcephaly. The disease as </p>
<p>such is a self-limiting disease with no casualties, but the </p>
<p>situation in the pregnant women is different. The mother </p>
<p>to fetal transmission of ZIKV could lead to fetal birth </p>
<p>defects and this is based on the initial but limited findings </p>
<p>reported by the amniocentesis findings in the </p>
<p>newborns[17]. Besides, transmission by blood, urine, </p>
<p>semen is also described in detail elsewhere[18-21]. </p>
<p>There is a paucity of scientific literature on this disease </p>
<p>and thus there is no definitive treatment options </p>
<p>available[17]. The only way to protect is to refrain from </p>
<p>mosquito bites[17]. The disease has led to total chaos and </p>
<p>fear and this is based on the reports in which the afflicted </p>
<p>countries have even requested the women to postpone </p>
<p>pregnancy[17]. The CDC has issued interim guidelines </p>
<p>to control ZIKV, but the same is not based on extensive </p>
<p>research and is only based on the whatsoever cases </p>
<p>available[22]. </p>
</section><heading>Conclusions </heading>
<p>There is an urgent need to control the infections </p>
<p>prevailing around the world. The role of surveillance is </p>
<p>extremely important as the new infections are emerging. </p>
<p>The efforts should be made to develop definitive </p>
<p>management guidelines. If the actions are not taken, then </p>
<p>there will be a complete chaos and large scale morbidity </p>
<p>and mortality. </p>
<p>The dissemination of healthcare information to all </p>
<p>the sections of the society is warranted. Furthermore, the </p>
<p>extensive research into the various aspects of the </p>
<p>aforementioned diseases is also imperative. </p>
